self-adaptable auto-scaler to react to workload fluctuations and
changing the resources assigned. The key problem is how and
when to add/remove resources in order to meet agreed servicelevel agreements. Reducing application cost and guaranteeing
service-level agreements (SLAs) are two critical factors of dynamic controller design. In this paper, we compare two dynamic
learning strategies based on a fuzzy logic system, which learns
and modifies fuzzy scaling rules at runtime. A self-adaptive fuzzy
logic controller is combined with two reinforcement learning
(RL) approaches: (i) Fuzzy SARSA learning (FSL) and (ii) Fuzzy
Q-learning (FQL). As an off-policy approach, Q-learning learns
independent of the policy currently followed, whereas SARSA
as an on-policy always incorporates the actual agent’s behavior
and leads to faster learning. Both approaches are implemented
and compared in their advantages and disadvantages, here in
the OpenStack cloud platform. We demonstrate that both autoscaling approaches can handle various load traffic situations,
sudden and periodic, and delivering resources on demand while
reducing operating costs and preventing SLA violations. The
experimental results demonstrate that FSL and FOL have acceptable performance in terms of adjusted number of virtual machine
targeted to optimize SLA compliance and response time.
