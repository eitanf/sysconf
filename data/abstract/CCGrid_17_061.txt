
This work addresses the problem of scheduling
user-defined analytic applications, which we define as high-level
compositions of frameworks, their components, and the logic
necessary to carry out work. The key idea in our application
definition, is to distinguish classes of components, including rigid
and elastic types: the first being required for an application to
make progress, the latter contributing to reduced execution times.
We show that the problem of scheduling such applications poses
new challenges, which existing approaches address inefficiently.

Thus, we present the design and evaluation of a novel, flexible
heuristic to schedule analytic applications, that aims at high
system responsiveness, by allocating resources efficiently. Our
algorithm is evaluated using trace-driven simulations, with largescale real system traces: our flexible scheduler outperforms a
baseline approach across a variety of metrics, including application turnaround times, and resource allocation efficiency.

We also present the design and evaluation of a full-fledged
system, which we have called Zoe, that incorporates the ideas
presented in this paper, and report concrete improvements in
terms of efficiency and performance, with respect to prior
generations of our system.
