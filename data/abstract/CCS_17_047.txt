mechanism that lets an authorized entity compute on encrypted
data, and learn the results in the clear. However, all current cryptographic instantiations for general FE are too impractical to be
implemented. We construct IRon, a provably secure, and practical
FE system using Intel’s recent Software Guard Extensions (SGX).
We show that Iron can be applied to complex functionalities, and
even for simple functions, outperforms the best known cryptographic schemes. We argue security by modeling FE in the context
of hardware elements, and prove that IRON satisfies the security
model.
