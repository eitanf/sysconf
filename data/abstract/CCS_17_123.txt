evaluation (SFE). Our stack consists of three components: i. a verified compiler (CircGen) that translates C programs into Boolean
circuits; ii. a verified implementation of Yao’s SFE protocol based on
garbled circuits and oblivious transfer; and iii. transparent application integration and communications via FRESCO, an open-source
framework for secure multiparty computation (MPC). CircGen is a
general purpose tool that builds on CompCert, a verified optimizing
compiler for C. It can be used in arbitrary Boolean circuit-based
cryptography deployments. The security of our SFE protocol implementation is formally verified using EasyCrypt, a tool-assisted
framework for building high-confidence cryptographic proofs, and
it leverages a new formalization of garbled circuits based on the
framework of Bellare, Hoang, and Rogaway (CCS 2012). We conduct
a practical evaluation of our approach, and conclude that it is competitive with state-of-the-art (unverified) approaches. Our work
provides concrete evidence of the feasibility of building efficient,
verified, implementations of higher-level cryptographic systems.
All our development is publicly available.
