which can easily exceed the robot’s onboard computer capability.
A promising solution to address this challenge is outsourcing the
computation to the cloud. However, exploiting the potential of
cloud resources in robotic software is difficult, because it involves complex code modification and extensive (re)configuration
procedures. Moreover, quality of service (QoS) such as timeliness,
which is critical to robot’s behavior, have to be considered. In
this paper, we propose a transparent and QoS-aware software
framework called Cloudroid for cloud robotic applications. This
framework supports direct deployment of existing robotic software packages to the cloud, transparently transforming them
into Internet-accessible cloud services. And with the automatically generated service stubs, robotic applications can outsource
their computation to the cloud without any code modification.
Furthermore, the robot and the cloud can cooperate to maintain
the specific QoS property such as request response time, even
in a highly dynamic and resource-competitive environment. We
evaluated Cloudroid based on a group of typical robotic scenarios
and a set of software packages widely adopted in real-world
robot practices. Results show that robots capability can be
enhanced significantly without code modification and specific QoS
objectives can be guaranteed. In certain tasks, the ’cloud + robot”
setup shows improved performance in orders of magnitude
compared with the robot native setup.
