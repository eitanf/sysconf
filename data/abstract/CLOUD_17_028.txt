
Network function virtualization has emerged as a
promising technology to enable rapid network service composition/innovation, energy conservation and cost minimization for
network operators. To optimally operate a virtualized network
service, it is of key importance to optimally deploy a VNF
(virtualized network function) service chain within the provisioning infrastructure (e.g., servers and the network within a
cloud datacenter), and dynamically scale it in response to flow
traffic changes. Most of the existing work on VNF scaling assume
access to precise network bandwidth information for placement
decisions, while in reality, network bandwidth typically fluctuates
following an unknown pattern and an effective way to adapt
to it is to do trials. In this paper, we address dynamic VNF
service chain deployment and scaling by a novel combination
of an online provisioning algorithm and a multi-armed bandit
optimization framework, which exploits online learning of the
available bandwidths to enable optimal deployment of a scaled
service chain. Specifically, we adopt the online algorithm to
minimize the cost for provisioning VNF instances on the go,
and a bandit-based online learning algorithm to place the
VNF instances which minimizes the congestion in a datacenter
network. We demonstrate effectiveness of our algorithms using
solid theoretical analysis and trace-driven evaluation.
