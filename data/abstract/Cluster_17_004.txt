
The availability and amount of sequenced
genomes have been rapidly growing in recent years because of
the adoption of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies
that enable high-throughput short-read generation at highly
competitive cost. Since this trend is expected to continue in the
foreseeable future, the design and implementation of efficient
and scalable NGS bioinformatics algorithms are important to
research and industrial applications. In this paper, we introduce
S-Aligner—a highly scalable read mapper designed for the
Sunway Taihu Light supercomputer and its fourth-generation
ShenWei many-core architecture (SW26010). S-Aligner employs a combination of optimization techniques to overcome
both the memory-bound and the compute-bound bottlenecks
in the read mapping algorithm. In order to make full use of
the compute power of Sunway Taihu Light, our design employs
three levels of parallelism: (1) internode parallelism using
MPI based on a task-grid pattern, (2) intranode parallelism
using multithreading and asynchronous data transfer to fully
utilize all 260 cores of the SW26010 many-core processor,
and (3) vectorization to exploit the available 256-bit SIMD
vector registers. Moreover, we have employed asynchronous
access patterns and data-sharing strategies during file I/O to
overcome bandwidth limitations of the network file system.
Our performance evaluation demonstrates that S-Aligner scales
almost linearly with approximately 95% efficiency for up to
13,312 nodes (concurrently harnessing more than 3 million
compute cores). Furthermore, our implementation on a single
node outperforms the established RazerS3 mapper running
on a platform with eight Intel Xeon E7-8860v3 CPUs while
achieving highly competitive alignment accuracy.
