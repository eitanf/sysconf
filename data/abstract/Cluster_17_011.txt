
The performance model of an application can provide understanding about its runtime behavior on particular
hardware. Such information can be analyzed by developers
for performance tuning. However, model building and analyzing is frequently ignored during software development until
performance problems arise because they require significant
expertise and can involve many time-consuming application
runs. In this paper, we propose a fast, accurate, flexible and
user-friendly tool, Mira, for generating performance models
by applying static program analysis, targeting scientific applications running on supercomputers. We parse both the
source code and binary to estimate performance attributes with
better accuracy than considering just source or just binary
code. Because our analysis is static, the target program does
not need to be executed on the target architecture, which
enables users to perform analysis on available machines instead
of conducting expensive experiments on potentially expensive
resources. Moreover, statically generated models enable performance prediction on nonexistent or unavailable architectures.
In addition to flexibility, because model generation time is significantly reduced compared to dynamic analysis approaches,
our method is suitable for rapid application performance
analysis and improvement. We present empirical validation
results to demonstrate the current capabilities of our approach
on small benchmarks and a mini application.
