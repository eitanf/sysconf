
It is common for real-world applications to analyze big graphs using distributed graph processing systems.
Popular in-memory systems require an enormous amount of
resources to handle big graphs. While several out-of-core
approaches have been proposed for processing big graphs on
disk, the high disk I/O overhead could significantly reduce
performance. In this paper, we propose GraphH to enable highperformance big graph analytics in small clusters. Specifically,
we design a two-stage graph partition scheme to evenly divide
the input graph into partitions, and propose a GAB (GatherApply-Broadcast) computation model to make each worker
process a partition in memory at a time. We use an edge
cache mechanism to reduce the disk I/O overhead, and design
a hybrid strategy to improve the communication performance.
GraphH can efficiently process big graphs in small clusters
or even a single commodity server. Extensive evaluations have
shown that GraphH could be up to 7.8x faster compared to
popular in-memory systems, such as Pregel+ and PowerGraph
when processing generic graphs, and more than 100x faster
than recently proposed out-of-core systems, such as GraphD
and Chaos when processing big graphs.
