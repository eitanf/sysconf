
Resource usage data, collected using tools such as
TACC_Stats, capture the resource utilization by nodes within
a high performance computing system. We present methods
to analyze the resource usage data to understand the system
performance and identify performance anomalies. The core idea
is to model the data as a three-way tensor corresponding to the
compute nodes, usage metrics, and time. Using the reconstruction
error between the original tensor and the tensor reconstructed
from a low rank tensor decomposition, as a scalar performance
metric, enables us to monitor the performance of the system in
an online fashion. This error statistic is then used for anomaly
detection that relies on the assumption that the normal/routine
behavior of the system can be captured using a low rank approximation of the original tensor. We evaluate the performance of
the algorithm using information gathered from system logs and
show that the performance anomalies identified by the proposed
method correlates with critical errors reported in the system logs.
Results are shown for data collected for 2013 from the Lonestar4
system at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC).
