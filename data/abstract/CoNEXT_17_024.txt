deployments are vulnerable to deadlocks induced by Priority Flow
Control (PFC). Prior solutions for deadlock prevention either require significant changes to routing protocols, or require excessive
buffers in the switches. In this paper, we propose Tagger, a scheme
for deadlock prevention. It does not require any changes to the routing protocol, and needs only modest buffers. Tagger is based on the
insight that given a set of expected lossless routes, a simple tagging
scheme can be developed to ensure that no deadlock will occur
under any failure conditions. Packets that do not travel on these
lossless routes may be dropped under extreme conditions. We design such a scheme, prove that it prevents deadlock and implement
it efficiently on commodity hardware.
