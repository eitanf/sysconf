infrastructure provisioning, public transportation, events planning,
and other domains. Monitoring city-wide mobile traffic is however
a complex and costly process that relies on dedicated probes. Some
of these probes have limited precision or coverage, others gather
tens of gigabytes of logs daily, which independently offer limited insights. Extracting fine-grained patterns involves expensive spatial
aggregation of measurements, storage, and post-processing. In this
paper, we propose a mobile traffic super-resolution technique that
overcomes these problems by inferring narrowly localised traffic
consumption from coarse measurements. We draw inspiration from
image processing and design a deep-learning architecture tailored
to mobile networking, which combines Zipper Network (ZipNet)
and Generative Adversarial neural Network (GAN) models. This enables to uniquely capture spatio-temporal relations between traffic
volume snapshots routinely monitored over broad coverage areas
(‘low-resolution’) and the corresponding consumption at 0.05 km?
level (‘high-resolution’) usually obtained after intensive computation. Experiments we conduct with a real-world data set demonstrate that the proposed ZipNet(-GAN) infers traffic consumption
with remarkable accuracy and up to 100x higher granularity as
compared to standard probing, while outperforming existing data
interpolation techniques. To our knowledge, this is the first time
super-resolution concepts are applied to large-scale mobile traffic
analysis and our solution is the first to infer fine-grained urban
traffic patterns from coarse aggregates.
