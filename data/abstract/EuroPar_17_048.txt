
. In data centers, up to dozens of tasks are colocated on a single physical machine. Machines are used more efficiently, but tasks’ performance deteriorates, as colocated tasks compete for shared resources.
As tasks are heterogeneous, the resulting performance dependencies are
complex. In our previous work [18] we proposed a new combinatorial
optimization model that uses two parameters of a task—its size and its
type—to characterize how a task influences the performance of other
tasks allocated to the same machine.

In this paper, we study the egalitarian optimization goal: maximizing the worst-off performance. This problem generalizes the classic makespan minimization on multiple processors (P||Cmax}. We prove
that polynomially-solvable variants of P||Cmax are NP-hard and hard to
approximate when the number of types is not constant. For a constant
number of types, we propose a PTAS, a fast approximation algorithm,
and aseries of heuristics. We simulate the algorithms on instances derived
from a trace of one of Google clusters. Algorithms aware of jobs’ types
lead to better performance compared to algorithms solving P||Cmax
The notion of type enables us to model degeneration of performance
caused by colocation using standard combinatorial optimization methods. Types add a layer of additional complexity. However, our results—
approximation algorithms and good average-case performance—show
that types can be handled efficiently.
