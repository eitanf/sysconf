tens to hundreds of nodes. In this paper, we employ a single
heterogeneous machine with fast storage media (e.g., NVMe
SSD) and massively parallel coprocessors (e.g., Xeon Phi)
to reach similar dimensions. By fully exploiting the heterogeneous devices, we design a new graph processing engine,
named MOSAIC, for a single machine. We propose a new
locality-optimizing, space-efficient graph representation—
Hilbert-ordered tiles, and a hybrid execution model that enables vertex-centric operations in fast host processors and
edge-centric operations in massively parallel coprocessors.

Our evaluation shows that for smaller graphs, MOSAIC
consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art out-of-core
engines by 3.2-58.6x and shows comparable performance
to distributed graph engines. Furthermore, MOSAIC can
complete one iteration of the Pagerank algorithm on a trillionedge graph in 21 minutes, outperforming a distributed diskbased engine by 9.2x.
