scalability of shared-nothing, transactional, in-memory
NewSQL databases have reopened the research question
of whether distributed metadata for hierarchical file systems can be managed using commodity databases. In this
paper, we introduce HopsFS, a next generation distribution of the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) that
replaces HDFS’ single node in-memory metadata service,
with a distributed metadata service built on a NewSQL
database. By removing the metadata bottleneck, HopsFS
enables an order of magnitude larger and higher throughput clusters compared to HDFS. Metadata capacity has
been increased to at least 37 times HDFS’ capacity, and
in experiments based on a workload trace from Spotify,
we show that HopsFS supports 16 to 37 times the throughput of Apache HDFS. HopsFS also has lower latency for
many concurrent clients, and no downtime during failover.
Finally, as metadata is now stored in a commodity database, it can be safely extended and easily exported to
external systems for online analysis and free-text search.
