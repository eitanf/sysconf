
Recent interest in persistent memory (PM) has stirred development of index structures that are efficient in PM.
Recent such developments have all focused on variations
of the B-tree. In this paper, we show that the radix tree,
which is another less popular indexing structure, can be
more appropriate as an efficient PM indexing structure.
This is because the radix tree structure is determined by
the prefix of the inserted keys and also does not require
tree rebalancing operations and node granularity updates.
However, the radix tree as-is cannot be used in PM. As
another contribution, we present three radix tree variants,
namely, WORT (Write Optimal Radix Tree), WOART
(Write Optimal Adaptive Radix Tree), and ART+CoW.
Of these, the first two are optimal for PM in the sense that
they only use one 8-byte failure-atomic write per update
to guarantee the consistency of the structure and do not
require any duplicate copies for logging or CoW. Extensive performance studies show that our proposed radix
tree variants perform considerable better than recently
proposed B-tree variants for PM such NVTree, wB+Tree,
and FPTree for synthetic workloads as well as in implementations within Memcached.
