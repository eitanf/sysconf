
 Knowing how many people occupy a building,
and where they are located, is a key component of smart building
services. Commercial, industrial and residential buildings often
incorporate systems used to determine occupancy. However,
relatively simple sensor technology and control algorithms limit
the effectiveness of smart building services. In this paper we
propose to replace sensor technology with time series models that
can predict the number of occupants at a given location and time.

We use Wi-Fi datasets readily available in abundance for
smart building services and train Auto Regression Integrating
Moving Average (ARIMA) models and Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) time series models. As a use case scenario of
smart building services, these models allow forecasting of the
number of people at a given time and location in 15, 30 and 60
minutes time intervals at building as well as Access Point (AP)
level. For LSTM, we build our models in two ways: a separate
model for every time scale, and a combined model for the three
time scales. Our experiments show that LSTM combined model
reduced the computational resources with respect to the number
of neurons by 74.48 % for the AP level, and by 67.13 % for the
building level. Further, the root mean square error (RMSE) was
reduced by 88.2% - 93.4% for LSTM in comparison to ARIMA
for the building levels models and by 80.9 % - 87% for the AP
level models.
