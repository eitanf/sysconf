significant times in atmosphere models. These calculations also
present significant load imbalances due to varying cloud covers
over different regions of the grid. In this work, we accelerate
these calculations on Intel® Xeon Phi™ Coprocessor Systems.
By employing dynamic scheduling in OpenMP, we demonstrate
large reductions in load imbalance and about 10% increase in
speedups. By careful categorization of data as private, firstprivate
and shared, we minimize data copying overheads for the coprocessors. We identify regions of false sharing among threads and
eliminate them by loop rearrangements. We also employ proportional partitioning of independent column computations across
both the CPU and coprocessor cores based on the performance
ratio of the computations on the heterogeneous resources. These
techniques along with various vectorization strategies resulted in
about 30% improvement in convection calculations.
