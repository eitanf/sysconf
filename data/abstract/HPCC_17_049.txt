graph helps understand its structure and relation. As advances in
technology increase the amount of data, simplifying a large-scale
graph has attracted interests. Simplification reduces the size of
a graph while preserving its important properties.

In this paper, we propose the summarization algorithm to
simplify a graph focusing on degree correlation and clustering
coefficient. The degree correlation is a measure to assess the
influence of each vertex and their connections. The clustering
coefficient estimates latent connections between two distinct
vertices. To this end, we first separate a graph into communities.
Looking at groups instead of a graph itself allows us to extract
important vertices and edges more easily. We then categorize
communities into four cases and simplify them in different
ways to preserve the innate characteristics. The quantitative and
qualitative evaluations demonstrate how effectively our algorithm
serves the goal.

Overall, our contributions are as follows: (a) unique pattern:
We found that hubs are connected indirectly via low-degree
vertices. Sigcon preserves these vertices during simplification.
(b) efficient algorithm: Sigcon identifies influential vertices and
edges to simplify a graph on the basis of degree correlation and
clustering coefficient connecting vertices effectively.
