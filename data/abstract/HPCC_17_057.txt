
The emergence of Next Generation Sequencing
(NGS) platforms has increased the throughput of genomic sequencing and in turn the amount of data that needs to be
processed, requiring highly efficient computation for its analysis.
In this context, modern architectures including accelerators and
non-volatile memory are essential to enable the mass exploitation
of these bioinformatics workloads. This paper presents a redesign
of the main component of a state-of-the-art reference-free method
for variant calling, SMUFIN, which has been adapted to make
the most of GPUs and NVM devices. SMUFIN relies on counting the frequency of k-mers (substrings of length k) in DNA
sequences, which also constitutes a well-known problem for many
bioinformatics workloads, such as genome assembly. We propose
techniques to improve the efficiency of k-mer counting and to
scale-up workloads like SMUFIN that used to require 16 nodes
of Marenostrum 3 to a single machine with a GPU and NVM
drives. Results show that although the single machine is not able
to improve the time to solution of 16 nodes, its CPU time is 7.5x
shorter than the aggregate CPU time of the 16 nodes, with a
reduction in energy consumption of 5.5x.
