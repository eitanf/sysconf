
In today’s large-scale High Performance Computing (HPC) systems, an increasing portion of the computing
capacity is wasted due to failures and recoveries. It is expected
that exascale machines will decrease the mean time between
failures to a few hours, making fault tolerance a major
challenge. This work explores novel methodologies to fault
tolerance that achieve forward recovery, power-awareness, and
scalability. The proposed model, referred to as Rejuvenating
Shadows, is able to deal with multiple types of failure and
maintain consistent level of resilience. An implementation is
provided for MPI, and empirically evaluated with various
benchmark applications that represent a wide range of HPC
workloads. The results demonstrate Rejuvenating Shadows’
ability to tolerate high failure rates, and to outperform inmemory checkpointing/restart in both execution time and
resource utilization.
