agreement protocols. The most common practical agreement protocol, for such scenarios, is leader-based atomic broadcast. In this
work, we propose ALLCONCUR, a distributed system that provides
agreement through a leaderless concurrent atomic broadcast algorithm, thus, not suffering from the bottleneck of a central coordinator.
In ALLCONCUR, all components exchange messages concurrently
through a logical overlay network that employs early termination
to minimize the agreement latency. Our implementation of ALLCONCUR supports standard sockets-based TCP as well as highperformance InfiniBand Verbs communications. ALLCONCUR can
handle up to 135 million requests per second and achieves 17x higher
throughput than today’s standard leader-based protocols, such as
Libpaxos. Thus, ALLCONCUR is highly competitive with regard to
existing solutions and, due to its decentralized approach, enables
hitherto unattainable system designs in a variety of fields.
