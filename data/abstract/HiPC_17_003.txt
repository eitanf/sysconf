
 Triangle counting is an important building block
for finding key players in a graph. It is an integral part of
the popular clustering coefficient analytic and can be used
for pattern matching in social networks. A triangle, which is
also a 3-clique, represents a strong connection between three
players that are all connected. While counting triangles is not
overly expensive from a computational standpoint, especially in
comparison to centrality metrics (such as betweenness centrality
and closeness centrality), it can still prove to be prohibitive
for large scale networks, especially for those with a power-law
distribution. This problem only deepens for dynamic graphs
where the network is constantly changing, requiring constant
updating of the graph and the analytic. In this paper, we
present a new dynamic graph algorithm for counting triangles
that is based on an inclusion-exclusion formulation. While
our algorithm is independent of the computing platform, we
show performance results on an NVIDIA GPU. Our approach
handles 32 million updates per second, or up to 11 million
updates per second if the graph data structure is also updated.
In past approaches, when a vertex was affected due to an edge
insertion or deletion, it was necessary to find the triangles from
scratch for that given vertex. Our new formulation does not
need this and only requires considering the affected edges. As
such our algorithm is typically several hundred times faster
than the past approach - in some cases up to 819X faster.
