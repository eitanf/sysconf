market in the last decade due to their favorable computing
to energy ratio. In this age of Cloud data centers and Big
Data analytics, the focus is increasingly on power efficient
processing, rather than just high throughput computing. ARM’s
first commodity server-grade processor is the recent AMD A1100series processor, based on a 64-bit ARM Cortex A57 architecture.
In this paper, we study the performance and energy efficiency of a
server based on this ARM64 CPU, relative to a comparable server
running an AMD Opteron 3300-series x64 CPU, for Big Data
workloads. Specifically, we study these for Intel’s HiBench suite of
web, query and machine learning benchmarks on Apache Hadoop
v2.7 in a pseudo-distributed setup, for data sizes up to 20GB
files, 5M web pages and 500M tuples. Our results show that the
ARM64 server’s runtime performance is comparable to the x64
server for integer-based workloads like Sort and Hive queries,
and only lags behind for floating-point intensive benchmarks like
PageRank, when they do not exploit data parallelism adequately.
We also see that the ARM64 server takes are the energy, and has
an Energy Delay Product (EDP) that is 50 — 71% lower than the
x64 server. These results hold promise for ARM64 data centers
hosting Big Data workloads to reduce their operational costs,
while opening up opportunities for further analysis.
