
We present PKT, a new shared-memory parallel
algorithm and OpenMP implementation for the truss decomposition of large sparse graphs. A k-truss is a dense subgraph
definition that can be considered a relaxation of a clique.
Truss decomposition refers to a partitioning of all the edges
in the graph based on their k-truss membership. The truss
decomposition of a graph has many applications. We show
that our new approach PKT consistently outperforms other
truss decomposition approaches for a collection of large sparse
graphs and on a 24-core shared-memory server. PKT is based
on a recently proposed algorithm for k-core decomposition.
