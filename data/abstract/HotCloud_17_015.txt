load balancing and reduced latency to customers of cloud
services. To distribute multiple copies of data, cloud
providers depend on inter-datacenter WANs that ought to
be used efficiently considering their limited capacity and
the ever-increasing data demands. In this paper, we focus
on applications that transfer objects from one datacenter to several datacenters over dedicated inter-datacenter
networks. We present DCCast, a centralized Point to
Multi-Point (P2MP) algorithm that uses forwarding trees
to efficiently deliver an object from a source datacenter
to required destination datacenters. With low computational overhead, DCCast selects forwarding trees that
minimize bandwidth usage and balance load across all
links. With simulation experiments on Google’s GScale
network, we show that DCCast can reduce total bandwidth usage and tail Transfer Completion Times (TCT)
by up to 50% compared to delivering the same objects
via independent point-to-point (P2P) transfers.
