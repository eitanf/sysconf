
Self-adaptation can be realized in various ways.
Rule-based approaches prescribe the adaptation to be executed if
the system or environment satisfy certain conditions and result in
scalable solutions, however, with often only satisfying adaptation
decisions. In contrast, utility-driven approaches determine optimal adaptation decisions by using an often costly optimization
step, which typically does not scale well for larger problems. We
propose a rule-based and utility-driven approach that achieves
the beneficial properties of each of these directions such that
the adaptation decisions are optimal while the computation
remains scalable since an expensive optimization step can be
avoided. The approach can be used for the architecture-based
self-healing of large software systems. We define the utility for
large dynamic architectures of such systems based on patterns
capturing issues the self-healing must address and we use patternbased adaptation rules to resolve the issues. Defining the utility as
well as the adaptation rules pattern-based allows us to compute
the impact of each rule application on the overall utility and
to realize an incremental and efficient utility-driven self-healing.
We demonstrate the efficiency and optimality of our scheme in
comparative experiments with a static rule-based scheme as a
baseline and a utility-driven approach using a constraint solver.
