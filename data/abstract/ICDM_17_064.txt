
Given a collection of basic customer demographics
(e.g., age and gender) and their behavioral data (e.g., item
purchase histories), how can we predict sensitive demographics
(e.g., income and occupation) that not every customer makes
available?

This demographics prediction problem is modeled as a classification task in which a customer’s sensitive demographic y
is predicted from his feature vector zx. So far, two lines of
work have tried to produce a “good” feature vector z« from
the customer’s behavioral data: (1) application-specific feature
engineering using behavioral data and (2) representation learning
(such as singular value decomposition or neural embedding) on
behavioral data. Although these approaches successfully improve
the predictive performance, (1) designing a good feature requires
domain experts to make a great effort and (2) features obtained
from representation learning are hard to interpret.

To overcome these problems, we present a Relational Infinite
Support Vector Machine (R-iSVM), a mixture-of-experts model
that can leverage behavioral data. Instead of augmenting the
feature vectors of customers, R-iSVM uses behavioral data to
find out behaviorally similar customer clusters and constructs a
local prediction model at each customer cluster. In doing so, RiSVM successfully improves the predictive performance without
requiring application-specific feature designing and hard-tointerpret representations.

Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate
the predictive performance and interpretability of R-iSVM.
Furthermore, R-iSVM can co-exist with previous demographics
prediction methods to further improve their predictive performance.
