
In recent years, finding repetitive similar patterns
in time series has become a popular problem. These patterns are
called time series motifs. Recent studies show that using grammar
compression algorithms to find repeating patterns from the
symbolized time series holds promise in discovering approximate
motifs with variable length. However, grammar compression
algorithms are traditionally designed for string compression.
Therefore, existing work on grammar induction has not fully
utilized much available information that can be used to enhance
the performance of the algorithms. In this work, an iterative
framework based on grammar induction is proposed. In each
iteration, a revision operator called Noise Reduction Operator is
applied to revise the symbolized time series string based on the
rules returned from a base grammar induction algorithm. In our
experiments, we show that the proposed work can find motifs of
the same quality, with much faster running time compared to the
state-of-the-art variable-length exact motif discovery algorithm in
real world time series data.
