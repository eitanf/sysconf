influence functional properties of software systems as well
as non-functional ones, such as performance and memory
consumption. Researchers have successfully demonstrated
the correlation between feature selection and performance.
However, the generality of these performance models across
different hardware platforms has not yet been evaluated.

We propose a technique for enhancing generality of performance models across different hardware environments using
linear transformation. Empirical studies on three real-world
software systems show that our approach is computationally
efficient and can achieve high accuracy (less than 10% mean
relative error) when predicting system performance across
23 different hardware platforms. Moreover, we investigate
why the approach works by comparing performance distributions of systems and structure of performance models across
different platforms.
