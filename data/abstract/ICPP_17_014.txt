
As we move towards an era of hundreds of cores,
the research community has witnessed the emergence of optoelectronic network on-chip designs based on nanophotonics, in
order to achieve higher network throughput, lower latencies,
and lower dynamic power. However, traditional nanophotonics
options face limitations such as large device footprints compared with electronics, higher static power due to continuous
laser operation, and an upper limit on achievable data rates due
to large device capacitances. Nanoplasmonics is an emerging
technology that has the potential for providing transformative
gains on multiple metrics due to its potential to increase
the light-matter interaction. In this paper, we propose and
analyze a hybrid opto-electric NoC that incorporates Hybrid Plasmonics Photonics Interconnect (HyPPI), an optical
interconnect that combines photonics with plasmonics. We
explore various opto-electronic network hybridization options
by augmenting a mesh network with HyPPI links, and compare
them with the equivalent options afforded by conventional
nanophotonics as well as pure electronics. Our design space
exploration indicates that augmenting an electronic NoC with
HyPPI gives a performance to cost ratio improvement of up
to 1.8x. To further validate our estimates, we conduct trace
based simulations using the NAS Parallel Benchmark suite.
These benchmarks show latency improvements up to 1.64x,
with negligible energy increase. We then further carry out
performance and cost projections for fully optical NoCs, using
HyPPI as well as conventional nanophotonics. These futuristic
projections indicate that all-HyPPI NoCs would be two orders
more energy efficient than electronics, and two orders more
area efficient than all-photonic NoCs.
