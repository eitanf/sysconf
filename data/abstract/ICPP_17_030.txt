
This paper presents a low-overhead optimizer for
the ubiquitous sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) kernel. Architectural diversity among different processors together
with structural diversity among different sparse matrices lead
to bottleneck diversity. This justifies an SpMV optimizer that
is both matrix- and architecture-adaptive through runtime specialization. To this direction, we present an approach that first
identifies the performance bottlenecks of SpMV for a given
sparse matrix on the target platform either through profiling
or by matrix property inspection, and then selects suitable
optimizations to tackle those bottlenecks. Our optimization pool is
based on the widely used Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) sparse
matrix storage format and has low preprocessing overheads,
making our overall approach practical even in cases where
fast decision making and optimization setup is required. We
evaluate our optimizer on three x86-based computing platforms
and demonstrate that it is able to distinguish and appropriately
optimize SpMV for the majority of matrices in a representative
test suite, leading to significant speedups over the CSR and
Inspector-Executor CSR SpMV kernels available in the latest
release of the Intel MKL library.
