
Parallel computing architectures like GPUs have
traditionally been used to accelerate applications with dense and
highly-structured workloads; however, many important applications in science and engineering are irregular and dynamic in
nature, making their effective parallel implementation a daunting
task. Numerical simulation of charged particle beam dynamics is
one such application where the distribution of work and data in
the accurate computation of collective effects at each time step is
irregular and exhibits control-flow and memory access patterns
that are not readily amenable to GPU’s architecture. Algorithms
with these properties tend to present both significant branch and
memory divergence on GPUs which leads to severe performance
bottlenecks.

We present a novel cache-aware algorithm that uses machine
learning to address this problem. The algorithm presented here
uses supervised learning to adaptively model and track irregular
access patterns in the computation of collective effects at each
time step of the simulation to anticipate the future control-flow
and data access patterns. Access pattern forecast are then used to
formulate runtime decisions that minimize branch and memory
divergence on GPUs, thereby improving the performance of
collective effects computation at a future time step based on
the observations from earlier time steps. Experimental results on
NVIDIA Tesla K40 GPU shows that our approach is effective
in maximizing data reuse, ensuring workload balance among
parallel threads, and in minimizing both branch and memory
divergence. Further, the parallel implementation delivers up to
485 Gflops of double precision performance, which translates to
a speedup of up to 2.5X compared to the fastest known GPU
implementation.
