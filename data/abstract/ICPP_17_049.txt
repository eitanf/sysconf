
The exponential growth of available data has
increased the need for interactive exploratory analysis. Dataset
can no longer be understood through manual crawling and
simple statistics. In Geographical Information Systems (GIS),
the dataset is often composed of events localized in space and
time; and visualizing such a dataset involves building a map
of where the events occurred.

We focus in this paper on events that are localized among
three dimensions (latitude, longitude, and time), and on computing the first step of the visualization pipeline, space-time
kernel density estimation (STKDE), which is most computationally expensive. Starting from a gold standard implementation, we show how algorithm design and engineering, parallel
decomposition, and scheduling can be applied to bring near
real-time computing to space-time kernel density estimation.
We validate our techniques on real world datasets extracted
from infectious disease, social media, and ornithology.
