
In parallel computing, a valid graph coloring
yields a lock-free processing of the colored tasks, data points,
etc., without expensive synchronization mechanisms. However,
coloring is not free and the overhead can be significant. In
particular, for the bipartite-graph partial coloring (BGPC)
and distance-2 graph coloring (D2GC) problems, which have
various use-cases within the scientific computing and numerical
optimization domains, the coloring overhead can be in the
order of minutes with a single thread for many real-life graphs.

In this work, we propose parallel algorithms for bipartitegraph partial coloring on shared-memory architectures. Compared to the existing shared-memory BGPC algorithms, the
proposed ones employ greedier and more optimistic techniques
that yield a better parallel coloring performance. In particular,
on 16 cores, the proposed algorithms are more than 4x faster
than their counterparts in the ColPack library which is, to
the best of our knowledge, the only publicly-available coloring
library for multicore architectures. In addition to BGPC, the
proposed techniques are employed to devise parallel distance-2
graph coloring algorithms and similar performance improvements have been observed. Finally, we propose two costless
balancing heuristics for BGPC that can reduce the skewness
and imbalance on the cardinality of color sets (almost) for free.
The heuristics can also be used for the D2GC problem and in
general, they will probably yield a better color-based parallelization performance especially on many-core architectures.
