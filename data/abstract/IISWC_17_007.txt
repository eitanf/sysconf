
Three-dimensional (3D)-stacking technology, which
enables the integration of DRAM and logic dies, offers high
bandwidth and low energy consumption. This technology also
empowers new memory designs for executing tasks not traditionally associated with memories. A practical 3D-stacked memory is
Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC), which provides significant access
bandwidth and low power consumption in a small area. Although
several studies have taken advantage of the novel architecture
of HMC, its characteristics in terms of latency and bandwidth
or their correlation with temperature and power consumption
have not been fully explored. This paper is the first, to the
best of our knowledge, to characterize the thermal behavior of
HMC in a real environment using the AC-510 accelerator and
to identify temperature as a new limitation for this state-ofthe-art design space. Moreover, besides bandwidth studies, we
deconstruct factors that contribute to latency and reveal their
sources for high- and low-load accesses. The results of this paper
demonstrates essential behaviors and performance bottlenecks for
future explorations of packet-switched and 3D-stacked memories.
