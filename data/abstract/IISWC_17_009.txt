
Block traces are widely used for system studies, model
verifications, and design analyses in both industry and academia.
While such traces include detailed block access patterns, existing
trace-driven research unfortunately often fails to find truenorth due to a lack of runtime contexts such as user idle
periods and system delays, which are fundamentally linked to
the characteristics of target storage hardware. In this work, we
propose TraceTracker, a novel hardware/software co-evaluation
method that allows users to reuse a broad range of the existing
block traces by keeping most their execution contexts and user
scenarios while adjusting them with new system information.
Specifically, our TraceTracker’s software evaluation model can
infer CPU burst times and user idle periods from old storage
traces, whereas its hardware evaluation method remasters the
storage traces by interoperating the inferred time information,
and updates all inter-arrival times by making them aware of
the target storage system. We apply the proposed co-evaluation
model to 577 traces, which were collected by servers from
different institutions and locations a decade ago, and revive
the traces on a high-performance flash-based storage array.
The evaluation results reveal that the accuracy of the execution
contexts reconstructed by TraceTracker is on average 99% and
96% with regard to the frequency of idle operations and the total
idle periods, respectively.
