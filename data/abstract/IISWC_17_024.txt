
Cameras are the defacto sensor. The growing demand for real-time and low-power computer vision, coupled
with trends towards high-efficiency heterogeneous systems, has
given rise to a wide range of image processing acceleration
techniques at the camera node and in the cloud. In this paper,
we characterize two novel camera systems that use acceleration
techniques to push the extremes of energy and performance
scaling, and explore the computation-communication tradeoffs
in their design. The first case study targets a camera system
designed to detect and authenticate individual faces, running
solely on energy harvested from RFID readers. We design a
multi-accelerator SoC design operating in the sub-mW range,
and evaluate it with real-world workloads to show performance
and energy efficiency improvements over a general purpose
microprocessor. The second camera system supports a 16-camera
rig processing over 32 Gb/s of data to produce real-time 3D-360°
virtual reality video. We design a multi-FPGA processing pipeline
that outperforms CPU and GPU configurations by up to 10x
in computation time, producing panoramic stereo video directly
from the camera rig at 30 frames per second. We find that an
early data reduction step, either before complex processing or
offloading, is the most critical optimization for in-camera systems.
