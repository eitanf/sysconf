
 We present a_ single-node, multi-GPU programmable graph processing library that allows programmers
to easily extend single-GPU graph algorithms to achieve
scalable performance on large graphs with billions of edges.
Directly using the single-GPU implementations, our design only
requires programmers to specify a few algorithm-dependent
concerns, hiding most multi-GPU related implementation details. We analyze the theoretical and practical limits to scalability in the context of varying graph primitives and datasets.
We describe several optimizations, such as direction optimizing
traversal, and a just-enough memory allocation scheme, for better performance and smaller memory consumption. Compared
to previous work, we achieve best-of-class performance across
operations and datasets, including excellent strong and weak
scalability on most primitives as we increase the number of
GPUs in the system.
