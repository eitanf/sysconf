
Similarity search is a critical primitive for a wide
variety of applications including natural language processing, content-based search, machine learning, computer vision,
databases, robotics, and recommendation systems. At its core,
similarity search is implemented using the k-nearest neighbors
(KNN) algorithm, where computation consists of highly parallel
distance calculations and a global top-k sort. In contemporary von-Neumann architectures, KNN is bottlenecked by data
movement which limits throughput and latency. In this paper,
we present and evaluate a novel automata-based algorithm for
KNN on the Micron Automata Processor (AP), which is a nonvon Neumann near-data processing architecture. By employing
near-data processing, the AP minimizes the data movement
bottleneck and is able to achieve better performance. Unlike
prior work in the automata processing space, our work combines
temporal encodings with automata design to augment the space
of applications for the AP. We evaluate our design’s performance
on the AP and compare to state-of-the-art CPU, GPU, and
FPGA implementations; we show that the current generation
of AP hardware can achieve over 50x speedup over CPUs
while maintaining competitive energy efficiency gains. We also
propose several automata optimization techniques and simple
architectural extensions that highlight the potential of the AP
hardware.
