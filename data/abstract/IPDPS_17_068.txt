
We design and develop a work-efficient multithreaded algorithm for sparse matrix-sparse vector multiplication
(SpMSpV) where the matrix, the input vector, and the output
vector are all sparse. SpMSpV is an important primitive in
the emerging GraphBLAS standard and is the workhorse of
many graph algorithms including breadth-first search, bipartite
graph matching, and maximal independent set. As thread counts
increase, existing multithreaded SpMSpV algorithms can spend
more time accessing the sparse matrix data structure than doing
arithmetic. Our shared-memory parallel SpMSpV algorithm is
work efficient in the sense that its total work is proportional to
the number of arithmetic operations required. The key insight is
to avoid each thread individually scan the list of matrix columns.

Our algorithm is simple to implement and operates on existing
column-based sparse matrix formats. It performs well on diverse
matrices and vectors with heterogeneous sparsity patterns. A
high-performance implementation of the algorithm attains up to
15x speedup on a 24-core Intel Ivy Bridge processor and up to 49x
speedup on a 64-core Intel KNL manycore processor. In contrast
to implementations of existing algorithms, the performance of our
algorithm is sustained on a variety of different input types include
matrices representing scale-free and high-diameter graphs.
