
We consider load balancing in a network of caching
servers delivering contents to end users. Randomized load
balancing via the so-called power of two choices is a wellknown approach in parallel and distributed systems that reduces
network imbalance. In this paper, we propose a randomized
load balancing scheme which simultaneously considers cache size
limitation and proximity in the server redirection process.

Since the memory limitation and the proximity constraint
cause correlation in the server selection process, we may not
benefit from the power of two choices in general. However, we
prove that in certain regimes, in terms of memory limitation
and proximity constraint, our scheme results in the maximum
load of order O(log log 7) (here n is the number of servers and
requests), and at the same time, leads to a low communication
cost. This is an exponential improvement in the maximum load
compared to the scheme which assigns each request to the nearest
available replica. Finally, we investigate our scheme performance
by extensive simulations.
