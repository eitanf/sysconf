
Today’s HPC applications are producing extremely large amounts of data, such that data storage and
analysis are becoming more challenging for scientific research.
In this work, we design a new error-controlled lossy compression algorithm for large-scale scientific data. Our key
contribution is significantly improving the prediction hitting
rate (or prediction accuracy) for each data point based on
its nearby data values along multiple dimensions. We derive
a series of multilayer prediction formulas and their unified
formula in the context of data compression. One serious
challenge is that the data prediction has to be performed based
on the preceding decompressed values during the compression
in order to guarantee the error bounds, which may degrade
the prediction accuracy in turn. We explore the best layer
for the prediction by considering the impact of compression
errors on the prediction accuracy. Moreover, we propose an
adaptive error-controlled quantization encoder, which can further improve the prediction hitting rate considerably. The data
size can be reduced significantly after performing the variablelength encoding because of the uneven distribution produced by
our quantization encoder. We evaluate the new compressor on
production scientific data sets and compare it with many other
state-of-the-art compressors: GZIP, FPZIP, ZFP, SZ-1.1, and
ISABELA. Experiments show that our compressor is the best
in class, especially with regard to compression factors (or bitrates) and compression errors (including RMSE, NRMSE, and
PSNR). Our solution is better than the second-best solution
by more than a 2x increase in the compression factor and
3.8x reduction in the normalized root mean squared error on
average, with reasonable error bounds and user-desired bitrates.
