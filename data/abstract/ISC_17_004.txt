
. Molecular Dynamics is an important tool for computational
biologists, chemists, and materials scientists, consuming a sizable amount
of supercomputing resources. Many of the investigated systems contain
charged particles, which can only be simulated accurately using a longrange solver, such as PPPM. We extend the popular LAMMPS molecular
dynamics code with an implementation of PPPM particularly suitable
for the second generation Intel Xeon Phi. Our main target is the optimization of computational kernels by means of vectorization, and we
observe speedups in these kernels of up to 12x. These improvements
carry over to LAMMPS users, with overall speedups ranging between
2-3x, without requiring users to retune input parameters. Furthermore,
our optimizations make it easier for users to determine optimal input
parameters for attaining top performance.
