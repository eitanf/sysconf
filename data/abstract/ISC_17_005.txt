
. Reduction of communication and efficient partitioning are
key issues for achieving scalability in hierarchical N-Body algorithms
like Fast Multipole Method (FMM). In the present work, we propose three
independent strategies to improve partitioning and reduce communication. First, we show that the conventional wisdom of using space-filling
curve partitioning may not work well for boundary integral problems,
which constitute a significant portion of FMM’s application user base. We
propose an alternative method that modifies orthogonal recursive bisection to relieve the cell-partition misalignment that has kept it from scaling previously. Secondly, we optimize the granularity of communication
to find the optimal balance between a bulk-synchronous collective communication of the local essential tree and an RDMA per task per cell.
Finally, we take the dynamic sparse data exchange proposed by Hoefler
et al. [1] and extend it to a hierarchical sparse data exchange, which is
demonstrated at scale to be faster than the MPI library’s MPI_Alltoallv
that is commonly used.
