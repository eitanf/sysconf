
The advent of Persistent Memory (PM), which is
anticipated to have byte-addressable access latency in par with
DRAM and yet nonvolatile, has stepped up interest in using PM
as storage. Hence, PM storage targeted file systems are being
developed under the premise that legacy file systems are suboptimal on memory bus attached PM-based storage. However,
many years of time and effort are ingrained in legacy file
systems that are now time-tested and mature. Simply scrapping
them altogether may be unwarranted. In this paper, we look
into how we can leverage the maturity ingrained in legacy file
systems to the fullest, while, at the same time, reaping the high
performance offered by PM. To this end, we first go through
a thorough analysis of legacy Ext4 file systems, and compare it
with NOVA, PMES, and Ext4 with DAX extension, which are new
PM file systems available in Linux. Based on these analyses, we
then propose the Persistent Memory Adaptation Layer (PMAL)
module that is lightweight (roughly 180 LoC) and can easily
be integrated into legacy file systems to take advantage of PM
storage. Using Ext4, we show that the performance of PMAL
integrated Ext4 is in par with PM file systems for the Filebench
and key-value store benchmarks.
