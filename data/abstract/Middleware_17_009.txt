
Distributed Complex Event Processing (DCEP) is a paradigm to infer the occurrence of complex situations in the surrounding world
from basic events like sensor readings. In doing so, DCEP operators detect event patterns on their incoming event streams. To
yield high operator throughput, data parallelization frameworks
divide the incoming event streams of an operator into overlapping
windows that are processed in parallel by a number of operator
instances. In doing so, the basic assumption is that the different
windows can be processed independently from each other. However, consumption policies enforce that events can only be part of
one pattern instance; then, they are consumed, ie., removed from
further pattern detection. That implies that the constituent events
of a pattern instance detected in one window are excluded from all
other windows as well, which breaks the data parallelism between
different windows. In this paper, we tackle this problem by means
of speculation: Based on the likelihood of an event’s consumption
in a window, subsequent windows may speculatively suppress that
event. We propose the SPECTRE framework for speculative processing of multiple dependent windows in parallel. Our evaluations
show an up to linear scalability of SPECTRE with the number of
CPU cores.
