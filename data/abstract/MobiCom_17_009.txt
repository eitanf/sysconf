and achieve lower delays by empowering two radios to simultaneously transmit in the same frequency band. However, full duplex is
only available between two adjacent nodes within the communication range. In this paper, we present BiPass to break this limitation.
With the help of full duplex capable relays, we enable simultaneous bidirectional in-band cut-through transmissions between two
far apart nodes, so they can do full duplex communications as if
they were within each other’s transmission range. To design such a
system, we analyze interference patterns and propose a loop-back
interference cancellation strategy. We identify the power amplification problem at relay nodes and develop an algorithm to solve it.
We also develop a routing algorithm, an opportunistic forwarding
scheme, and a real-time feedback strategy to leverage this system
in ad-hoc networks. To evaluate the real world performance of
BiPass, we build a prototype and conduct experiments using software defined radios. We show that BiPass can achieve 1.6x median
throughput gain over state-of-the-art one-way cut-through systems, and 4.09x gain over the decode-and-forward scheme. Our
simulations further reveal that even when the data traffic is not
bidirectional, BiPass has 1.36x throughput gain and 47% delay reduction over one-way cut-through systems in large networks.
