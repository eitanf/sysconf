
Non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies such as PCM, ReRAM and STT-RAM allow processors to directly
write values to persistent storage at speeds that are significantly faster than previous durable media such
as hard drives or SSDs. Many applications of NVM are constructed on a logging subsystem, which enables
operations to appear to execute atomically and facilitates recovery from failures. Writes to NVM, however,
pass through a processor’s memory system, which can delay and reorder them and can impair the correctness
and cost of logging algorithms.
Reordering arises because of out-of-order execution in a CPU and the inter-processor cache coherence
protocol. By carefully considering the properties of these reorderings, this paper develops a logging protocol
that requires only one round trip to non-volatile memory while avoiding expensive computations. We show
how to extend the logging protocol to building a persistent set (hash map) that also requires only a single
round trip to non-volatile memory for insertion, updating, or deletion.
