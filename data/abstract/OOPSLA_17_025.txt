
Static analyses aspire to explore all possible executions in order to achieve soundness. Yet, in practice, they
fail to capture common dynamic behavior. Enhancing static analyses with dynamic information is a common
pattern, with tools such as Tamiflex. Past approaches, however, miss significant portions of dynamic behavior,
due to native code, unsupported features (e.g., invokedynamic or lambdas in Java), and more. We present
techniques that substantially counteract the unsoundness of a static analysis, with virtually no intrusion
to the analysis logic. Our approach is reified in the HeapDL toolchain and consists in taking whole-heap
snapshots during program execution, that are further enriched to capture significant aspects of dynamic
behavior, regardless of the causes of such behavior. The snapshots are then used as extra inputs to the static
analysis. The approach exhibits both portability and significantly increased coverage. Heap information
under one set of dynamic inputs allows a static analysis to cover many more behaviors under other inputs.
A HeapDL-enhanced static analysis of the DaCapo benchmarks computes 99.5% (median) of the call-graph
edges of unseen dynamic executions (vs. 76.9% for the Tamiflex tool).
