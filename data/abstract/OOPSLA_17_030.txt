Types are awesome. Languages like OCaml and Haskell make the value-proposition for types
even more appealing by using constraints to automatically synthesize the types for all program
terms without troubling the programmer for any annotations. Unfortunately, this automation has
come at a price. Type annotations signify the programmer’s intent and help to correctly blame the
Localizing type errors is challenging in languages with global type inference, as the type checker must make
assumptions about what the programmer intended to do. We introduce Nate, a data-driven approach to
error localization based on supervised learning. Nate analyzes a large corpus of training data Ð pairs of
ill-typed programs and their łfixedž versions Ð to automatically learn a model of where the error is most likely
to be found. Given a new ill-typed program, Nate executes the model to generate a list of potential blame
assignments ranked by likelihood. We evaluate Nate by comparing its precision to the state of the art on
a set of over 5,000 ill-typed OCaml programs drawn from two instances of an introductory programming
course. We show that when the top-ranked blame assignment is considered, Nate’s data-driven model is
able to correctly predict the exact sub-expression that should be changed 72% of the time, 28 points higher
than OCaml and 16 points higher than the state-of-the-art SHErrLoc tool. Furthermore, Nate’s accuracy
surpasses 85% when we consider the top two locations and reaches 91% if we consider the top three.
