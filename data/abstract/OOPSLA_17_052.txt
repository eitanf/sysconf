
In application domains that store data in a tabular format, a common task is to fill the values of some cells
using values stored in other cells. For instance, such data completion tasks arise in the context of missing
value imputation in data science and derived data computation in spreadsheets and relational databases.
Unfortunately, end-users and data scientists typically struggle with many data completion tasks that require
non-trivial programming expertise. This paper presents a synthesis technique for automating data completion
tasks using programming-by-example (PBE) and a very lightweight sketching approach. Given a formula sketch
(e.g., AVG(?1, ?2)) and a few input-output examples for each hole, our technique synthesizes a program to
automate the desired data completion task. Towards this goal, we propose a domain-specific language (DSL)
that combines spatial and relational reasoning over tabular data and a novel synthesis algorithm that can
generate DSL programs that are consistent with the input-output examples. The key technical novelty of our
approach is a new version space learning algorithm that is based on finite tree automata (FTA). The use of
FTAs in the learning algorithm leads to a more compact representation that allows more sharing between
programs that are consistent with the examples. We have implemented the proposed approach in a tool called
DACE and evaluate it on 84 benchmarks taken from online help forums. We also illustrate the advantages of
our approach by comparing our technique against two existing synthesizers, namely Prose and Sketch.
