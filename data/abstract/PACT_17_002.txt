
The Go language lacks built-in data structures
that allow fine-grained concurrent access. In particular, its map
data type, one of only two generic collections in Go, limits
concurrency to the case where all operations are read-only;
any mutation (insert, update, or remove) requires exclusive
access to the entire map. The tight integration of this map into
the Go language and runtime precludes its replacement with
known scalable map implementations.

This paper introduces the Interlocked Hash Table (IHT). The
THT is the result of language-driven data structure design: it
requires minimal changes to the Go map API, supports the
full range of operations available on the sequential Go map,
and provides a path for the language to evolve to become more
amenable to scalable computation over shared data structures.
The IHT employs a novel optimistic locking protocol to avoid
the risk of deadlock, and allows large critical sections that
access a single IHT element, and can easily support multikey atomic operations. These features come at the cost of
relaxed, though still straightforward, iteration semantics. In
experimentation in both Java and Go, the IHT performs well,
reaching up to 7x the performance of the state of the art in Go
at 24 threads. In Java, the IHT performs on par with the best
Java maps in the research literature, while providing iteration
and other features absent from other maps.
