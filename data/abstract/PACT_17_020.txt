
The memory model for RISC-V, a newly developed
open source ISA, has not been finalized yet and thus, offers an
opportunity to evaluate existing memory models. We believe
RISC-V should not adopt the memory models of POWER or
ARM, because their axiomatic and operational definitions are
too complicated. We propose two new weak memory models:
WMM and WMM.-S, which balance definitional simplicity and
implementation flexibility differently. Both allow all instruction
reorderings except overtaking of loads by a store. We show
that this restriction has little impact on performance and it
considerably simplifies operational definitions. It also rules
out the out-of-thin-air problem that plagues many definitions.
WMM is simple (it is similar to the Alpha memory model),
but it disallows behaviors arising due to shared store buffers
and shared write-through caches (which are seen in POWER
processors). WMM-S, on the other hand, is more complex and
allows these behaviors. We give the operational definitions of
both models using Instantaneous Instruction Execution (7E),
which has been used in the definitions of SC and TSO. We also
show how both models can be implemented using conventional
cache-coherent memory systems and out-of-order processors,
and encompasses the behaviors of most known optimizations.
