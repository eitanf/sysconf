associated with implementing reliable storage services from
a collection of fault-prone servers have recently become an
actively studied question. The well-known ABD result shows
that an f-tolerant register can be emulated using a collection
of 2f +1 fault-prone servers each storing a single read-modifywrite object, which is known to be optimal. In this paper
we generalize this bound: we investigate the inherent space
complexity of emulating reliable multi-writer registers as
a function of the type of the base objects exposed by the
underlying servers, the number of writers to the emulated
register, the number of available servers, and the failure
threshold.

We establish a sharp separation between registers, and both
max-registers (the base object type assumed by ABD) and
CAS in terms of the resources (i.e., the number of base objects
of the respective types) required to support the emulation;
we show that no such separation exists between max-registers
and CAS. Our main technical contribution is lower and upper
bounds on the resources required in case the underlying base
objects are fault-prone read/write registers. We show that the
number of required registers is directly proportional to the
number of writers and inversely proportional to the number
of servers.
