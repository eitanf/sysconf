
LCLs or locally checkable labelling problems (e.g. maximal independent set, maximal matching, and vertex colouring) in the LOCAL
model of computation are very well-understood in cycles (toroidal
1-dimensional grids): every problem has a complexity of O (1),
Θ(log∗ n), or Θ(n), and the design of optimal algorithms can be
fully automated.
This work develops the complexity theory of LCL problems for
toroidal 2-dimensional grids. The complexity classes are the same
as in the 1-dimensional case: O (1), Θ(log∗ n), and Θ(n). However,
given an LCL problem it is undecidable whether its complexity is
Θ(log∗ n) or Θ(n) in 2-dimensional grids.
Nevertheless, if we correctly guess that the complexity of a problem is Θ(log∗ n), we can completely automate the design of optimal
algorithms. For any problem we can find an algorithm that is of a
normal form A′ ◦Sk , where A′ is a finite function, Sk is an algorithm
for finding a maximal independent set in kth power of the grid, and
k is a constant.
Finally, partially with the help of automated design tools, we
classify the complexity of several concrete LCL problems related to
colourings and orientations.
