actions enable the use of time for distributed coordination. This
paper initiates an investigation of coordination in such a setting. A
new communication structure called a zigzag pattern is introduced,
and shown to guarantee bounds on the relative timing of events
in this clockless model. Indeed, zigzag patterns are shown to be
necessary and sufficient for establishing that events occur in a
manner that satisfies prescribed bounds. We capture when a process
can know that an appropriate zigzag pattern exists, and use this to
provide necessary and sufficient conditions for timed coordination
of events using a full-information protocol in the clockless model.
