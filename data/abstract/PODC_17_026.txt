provide a software-only fallback path to guarantee progress. The
design of the fallback path can have a profound impact on performance. If the fallback path is allowed to run concurrently with hardware transactions, then hardware transactions must be instrumented,
adding significant overhead. Otherwise, hardware transactions must
wait for any processes on the fallback path, causing concurrency
bottlenecks, or move to the fallback path. We introduce an approach
that combines the best of both worlds. The key idea is to use three
execution paths: an HTM fast path, an HTM middle path, and a softwate fallback path, such that the middle path can run concurrently
with each of the other two. The fast path and fallback path do not
run concurrently, so the fast path incurs no instrumentation overhead.
Furthermore, fast path transactions can move to the middle path
instead of waiting or moving to the software path. We demonstrate
our approach by producing an accelerated version of the tree update template of Brown et al., which can be used to implement fast
lock-free data structures based on down-trees. We used the accelerated template to implement two lock-free trees: a binary search tree
(BST), and an (a, b)-tree (a generalization of a B-tree). Experiments
show that, with 72 concurrent processes, our accelerated (a, b)-tree
performs between 4.0x and 4.2x as many operations per second as
an implementation obtained using the original tree update template.
