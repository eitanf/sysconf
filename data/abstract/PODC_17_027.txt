financial transactions through scripts called smart contracts. These
smart contracts are executed many, many times, always without
real concurrency. First, all smart contracts are serially executed
by miners before appending them to the blockchain. Later, those
contracts are serially re-executed by validators to verify that the
smart contracts were executed correctly by miners.

Serial execution limits system throughput and fails to exploit today’s concurrent multicore and cluster architectures. Nevertheless,
serial execution appears to be required: contracts share state, and
contract programming languages have a serial semantics.

This paper presents a novel way to permit miners and validators
to execute smart contracts in parallel, based on techniques adapted
from software transactional memory. Miners execute smart contracts speculatively in parallel, allowing non-conflicting contracts
to proceed concurrently, and “discovering” a serializable concurrent
schedule for a block’s transactions, This schedule is captured and
encoded as a deterministic fork-join program used by validators
to re-execute the miner’s parallel schedule deterministically but
concurrently.

Smart contract benchmarks run on a JVM with ScalaSTM show
that a speedup of 1.33x can be obtained for miners and 1.69x for
validators with just three concurrent threads.
