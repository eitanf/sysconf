by Milgram’s letter forwarding experiments from the 60s [60], was
theoretically explained by Kleinberg in 2000 [47]. However, from
today’s perspective his model has several severe shortcomings that
limit the applicability to real-world networks. In order to give a
more convincing explanation of the algorithmic small-world phenomenon, we study decentralized greedy routing in a more flexible
random graph model (geometric inhomogeneous random graphs)
which overcomes all previous shortcomings. Apart from exhibiting good properties in theory, it has also been extensively experimentally validated that this model reasonably captures real-world
networks.

In this model, the greedy routing protocol is purely distributed
as each vertex only needs to know information about its direct
neighbors. We prove that it succeeds with constant probability, and
in case of success almost surely finds an almost shortest path of
length O(log log n), where our bound is tight including the leading
constant. Moreover, we study natural local patching methods which
augment greedy routing by backtracking and which do not require
any global knowledge. We show that such methods can ensure
success probability 1 in an asymptotically tight number of steps.

These results also address the question of Krioukov et al. [52]
whether there are efficient local routing protocols for the internet
graph. There were promising experimental studies, but the question
remained unsolved theoretically. Our results give for the first time
a rigorous and analytical affirmative answer.
