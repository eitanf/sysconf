detection (or triangle finding) as well as triangle enumeration (triangle listing) play central roles in the field of graph algorithms. In
distributed computing, algorithms with sublinear round complexity
for triangle finding and listing have recently been developed in the
powerful CONGEST clique model, where communication is allowed
between any two nodes of the network. In this paper we present the
first algorithms with sublinear complexity for triangle finding and
triangle listing in the standard CONGEST model, where the communication topology is the same as the topology of the network. More
precisely, we give randomized algorithms for triangle finding and
listing with round complexity O(n?! 3(log n)?/3) and O(n3/4 log n),
respectively, where n denotes the number of nodes of the network.
We also show a lower bound Qn! 3 /log n) on the round complexity
of triangle listing, which also holds for the CONGEST clique model.
