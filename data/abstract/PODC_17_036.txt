anonymous, identical finite state agents. A protocol is well-specified
if from every initial configuration, all fair executions of the protocol
reach a common consensus. The central verification question for
population protocols is the well-specification problem: deciding if a
given protocol is well-specified. Esparza et al. have recently shown
that this problem is decidable, but with very high complexity: it
is at least as hard as the Petri net reachability problem, which is
EXPSPACE-hard, and for which only algorithms of non-primitive
recursive complexity are currently known.

In this paper we introduce the class WS? of well-specified
strongly-silent protocols and we prove that it is suitable for automatic verification. More precisely, we show that WS? has the
same computational power as general well-specified protocols, and
captures standard protocols from the literature. Moreover, we show
that the membership problem for WS? reduces to solving boolean
combinations of linear constraints over N. This allowed us to develop the first software able to automatically prove well-specification for all of the infinitely many possible inputs.
