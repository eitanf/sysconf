telephone model modified to better describe the local peer-to-peer
communication services implemented in many popular smartphone
operating systems. In more detail, the mobile telephone model differs from the classical telephone model in three ways: (1) each
device can participate in at most one connection per round; (2) the
network topology can undergo a parameterized rate of change; and
(3) devices can advertise a parameterized number of bits about their
state to their neighbors in each round before connection attempts
are initiated. We begin by describing and analyzing new randomized gossip algorithms in this model under the harsh assumption of
a network topology that can change completely in every round. We
prove a significant time complexity gap between the case where
nodes can advertise 0 bits to their neighbors in each round, and the
case where nodes can advertise 1 bit. For the latter assumption, we
present two solutions: the first depends on a shared randomness
source, while the second eliminates this assumption using a pseudorandomness generator we prove to exist with a novel generalization
of a classical result from the study of two-party communication
complexity. We then turn our attention to the easier case where
the topology graph is stable, and describe and analyze a new gossip
algorithm that provides a substantial performance improvement
for many parameters. We conclude by studying a relaxed version
of gossip in which it is only necessary for nodes to each learn a
specified fraction of the messages in the system. We prove that our
existing algorithms for dynamic network topologies and a single
advertising bit solve this relaxed version up to a polynomial factor
faster (in network size) for many parameters. These are the first
known gossip results for the mobile telephone model, and they
significantly expand our understanding of how to communicate
and coordinate in this increasingly relevant setting.
