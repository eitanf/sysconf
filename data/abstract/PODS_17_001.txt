down to computing the probability of a suitable Boolean
function, the lineage of the query over the database. The
method of query compilation approaches the task in two
stages: first, the query lineage is implemented (compiled) in
a circuit form where probability computation is tractable;
and second, the desired probability is computed over the
compiled circuit. A basic theoretical quest in query compilation is that of identifying pertinent classes of queries
whose lineages admit compact representations over increasingly succinct, tractable circuit classes.

Fostering previous work by Jha and Suciu (ICDT 2012)
and Petke and Razgon (SAT 2013), we focus on queries
whose lineages admit circuit implementations with small
treewidth, and investigate their compilability within tame
classes of decision diagrams. In perfect analogy with the
characterization of bounded circuit pathwidth by bounded
OBDD width, we show that a class of Boolean functions
has bounded circuit treewidth if and only if it has bounded
SDD width. Sentential decision diagrams (SDDs) are central in knowledge compilation, being essentially as tractable
as OBDDs but exponentially more succinct. By incorporating constant width (linear size) SDDs and polynomial size
SDDs in the picture, we refine the panorama of query compilation for unions of conjunctive queries with and without
inequalities.
