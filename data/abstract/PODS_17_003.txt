
We consider the task of enumerating and counting answers
to k-ary conjunctive queries against relational databases that
may be updated by inserting or deleting tuples.

We exhibit a new notion of g-hierarchical conjunctive queries and show that these can be maintained efficiently in the
following sense. During a linear time preprocessing phase,
we can build a data structure that enables constant delay
enumeration of the query results; and when the database is
updated, we can update the data structure and restart the
enumeration phase within constant time. For the special
case of self-join free conjunctive queries we obtain a dichotomy: if a query is not q-hierarchical, then query enumeration with sublinear* delay and sublinear update time (and
arbitrary preprocessing time) is impossible.

For answering Boolean conjunctive queries and for the
more general problem of counting the number of solutions of
k-ary queries we obtain complete dichotomies: if the query’s
homomorphic core is q-hierarchical, then size of the the
query result can be computed in linear time and maintained
with constant update time. Otherwise, the size of the query
result cannot be maintained with sublinear update time.

All our lower bounds rely on the OMv-conjecture, a conjecture on the hardness of online matrix-vector multiplication that has recently emerged in the field of fine-grained
complexity to characterise the hardness of dynamic problems. The lower bound for the counting problem additionally relies on the orthogonal vectors conjecture, which in
turn is implied by the strong exponential time hypothesis.

*) By sublinear we mean O(n'—*) for some ¢ > 0, where
n is the size of the active domain of the current database.
