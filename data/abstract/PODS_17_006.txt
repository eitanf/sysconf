increasingly commonplace. Many such queries contain common subexpressions, either within a single query or among
multiple queries submitted as a batch. Conventional query
optimizers do not exploit these subexpressions and produce
sub-optimal plans. The problem of multi-query optimization (MQO) is to generate an optimal combined evaluation
plan by computing common subexpressions once and reusing
them. Exhaustive algorithms for MQO explore an O(n”)
search space. Thus, this problem has primarily been tackled
using various heuristic algorithms, without providing any
theoretical guarantees on the quality of their solution.

In this paper, instead of the conventional cost minimization problem, we treat the problem as maximizing a linear
transformation of the cost function. We propose a greedy
algorithm for this transformed formulation of the problem,
which under weak, intuitive assumptions, provides an approximation factor guarantee for this formulation. We go
on to show that this factor is optimal, unless P = NP. Another noteworthy point about our algorithm is that it can be
easily incorporated into existing transformation-based optimizers. We finally propose optimizations which can be used
to improve the efficiency of our algorithm.
