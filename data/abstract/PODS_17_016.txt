(GF). Our general aim is to classify the data complexity on the
level of ontologies where query evaluation w.r.t. an ontology O is
considered to be in PTIME if all (unions of conjunctive) queries
can be evaluated in PTIME w.rt. O and CONP-hard if at least one
query is CONP-hard w.rt. O. We identify several large and relevant fragments of GF that enjoy a dichotomy between PTIME and
CONP, some of them additionally admitting a form of counting. In
fact, almost all ontologies in the BioPortal repository fall into these
fragments or can easily be rewritten to do so. We then establish a
variation of Ladner’s Theorem on the existence of NP-intermediate
problems and use this result to show that for other fragments, there
is provably no such dichotomy. Again for other fragments (such as
full GF), establishing a dichotomy implies the Feder- Vardi conjecture on the complexity of constraint satisfaction problems. We also
link these results to Datalog-rewritability and study the decidability of whether a given ontology enjoys PTIME query evaluation,
presenting both positive and negative results.
