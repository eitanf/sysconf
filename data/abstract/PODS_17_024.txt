model: the sets that comprise the instance are revealed one
by one in a stream and the goal is to solve the problem by
making one or few passes over the stream while maintaining
a sublinear space o(mn) in the input size; here m denotes
the number of the sets and n is the universe size. Notice
that in this model, we are mainly concerned with the space
requirement of the algorithms and hence do not restrict their
computation time.

Our main result is a resolution of the space-approximation
tradeoff for the streaming set cover problem: we show that
any a@-approximation algorithm for the set cover problem requires O(mn/ *) space, even if it is allowed polylog(n) passes
over the stream, and even if the sets are arriving in a random order in the stream. This space-approximation tradeoff
matches the best known bounds achieved by the recent algorithm of Har-Peled et al. (PODS 2016) that requires only
O(a) passes over the stream in an adversarial order, hence
settling the space complexity of approximating the set cover
problem in data streams in a quite robust manner. Additionally, our approach yields tight lower bounds for the space
complexity of (1—<)-approximating the streaming maximum
coverage problem studied in several recent works.
