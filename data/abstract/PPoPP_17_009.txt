
This paper presents an algorithm based fault tolerance
method to harden three two-sided matrix factorizations
against soft errors: reduction to Hessenberg form, tridiagonal form, and bidiagonal form. These two sided factorizations are usually the prerequisites to computing eigenvalues/eigenvectors and singular value decomposition.

Algorithm based fault tolerance has been shown to work
on three main one-sided matrix factorizations: LU, Cholesky,
and QR, but extending it to cover two sided factorizations
is non-trivial because there are no obvious offline, problem
specific maintenance of checksums. We thus develop an online, algorithm specific checksum scheme and show how to
systematically adapt the two sided factorization algorithms
used in LAPACK and ScaLAPACK packages to introduce
the algorithm based fault tolerance.

The resulting ABFT scheme can detect and correct arithmetic errors continuously during the factorizations that allow
timely error handling. Detailed analysis and experiments are
conducted to show the cost and the gain in resilience. We
demonstrate that our scheme covers a significant portion of
the operations of the factorizations. Our checksum scheme
achieves high error detection coverage and error correction
coverage compared to the state of the art, with low overhead
and high scalability.
