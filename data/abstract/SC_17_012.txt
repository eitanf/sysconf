
Sympiler is a domain-specific code generator that optimizes sparse
matrix computations by decoupling the symbolic analysis phase
from the numerical manipulation stage in sparse codes. The computation patterns in sparse numerical methods are guided by the
input sparsity structure and the sparse algorithm itself. In many
real-world simulations, the sparsity pattern changes little or not at
all. Sympiler takes advantage of these properties to symbolically
analyze sparse codes at compile time and to apply inspector-guided
transformations that enable applying low-level transformations to
sparse codes. As a result, the Sympiler-generated code outperforms
highly-optimized matrix factorization codes from commonly-used
specialized libraries, obtaining average speedups over Eigen and
CHOLMOD of 3.8x and 1.5x respectively.
