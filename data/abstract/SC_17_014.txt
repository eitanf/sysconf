
The nature of dark energy and the complete theory of gravity
are two central questions currently facing cosmology. A vital tool
for addressing them is the 3-point correlation function (3PCF),
which probes deviations from a spatially random distribution of
galaxies. However, the 3PCF’s formidable computational expense
has prevented its application to astronomical surveys comprising millions to billions of galaxies. We present Galactos, a highperformance implementation of a novel, O(N?) algorithm that uses
a load-balanced k-d tree and spherical harmonic expansions to
compute the anisotropic 3PCF. Our implementation is optimized
for the Intel Xeon Phi architecture, exploiting SIMD parallelism,
instruction and thread concurrency, and significant L1 and L2 cache
reuse, reaching 39% of peak performance on a single node. Galactos
scales to the full Cori system, achieving 9.8 PF (peak) and 5.06 PF
(sustained) across 9636 nodes, making the 3PCF easily computable
for all galaxies in the observable universe.
