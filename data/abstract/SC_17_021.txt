applications. Many design and optimization efforts will benefit
from an in-depth understanding of memory access behavior, which
is not offered by extant access tracing and profiling methods.

In this paper, we adopt a holistic memory access profiling approach to enable a better understanding of program-system memory
interactions. We have developed a two-pass tool adopting fast online and slow offline profiling, with which we have profiled, at the
variable/object level, a collection of 38 representative applications
spanning major domains (HPC, personal computing, data analytics, AI, graph processing, and datacenter workloads), at varying
problem sizes. We have performed detailed result analysis and code
examination. Our findings provide new insights into application
memory behavior, including insights on per-object access patterns,
adoption of data structures, and memory-access changes at different problem sizes. We find that scientific computation applications
exhibit distinct behaviors compared to datacenter workloads, motivating separate memory system design/optimizations.
