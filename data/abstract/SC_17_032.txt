
Near-term quantum computers will soon reach sizes that are challenging to directly simulate, even when employing the most powerful supercomputers. Yet, the ability to simulate these early devices
using classical computers is crucial for calibration, validation, and
benchmarking. In order to make use of the full potential of systems featuring multi- and many-core processors, we use automatic
code generation and optimization of compute kernels, which also
enables performance portability. We apply a scheduling algorithm
to quantum supremacy circuits in order to reduce the required
communication and simulate a 45-qubit circuit on the Cori II supercomputer using 8, 192 nodes and 0.5 petabytes of memory. To our
knowledge, this constitutes the largest quantum circuit simulation
to this date. Our highly-tuned kernels in combination with the
reduced communication requirements allow an improvement in
time-to-solution over state-of-the-art simulations by more than an
order of magnitude at every scale.
