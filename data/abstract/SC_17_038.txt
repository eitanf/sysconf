
Modern OpenMP threading techniques are used to convert the
MPI-only Hartree-Fock code in the GAMESS program to a hybrid
MPI/OpenMP algorithm. Two separate implementations that differ
by the sharing or replication of key data structures among threads
are considered, density and Fock matrices. All implementations are
benchmarked on a super-computer of 3,000 Intel® Xeon Phi™ processors. With 64 cores per processor, scaling numbers are reported
on up to 192,000 cores. The hybrid MPI/OpenMP implementation
reduces the memory footprint by approximately 200 times compared to the legacy code. The MPI/OpenMP code was shown to
run up to six times faster than the original for a range of molecular
system sizes.
