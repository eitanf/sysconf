
Optimizing communication performance is imperative for largescale computing because communication overheads limit the strong
scalability of parallel applications. Today’s network cards contain
rather powerful processors optimized for data movement. However,
these devices are limited to fixed functions, such as remote direct
memory access. We develop sPIN, a portable programming model to
offload simple packet processing functions to the network card. To
demonstrate the potential of the model, we design a cycle-accurate
simulation environment by combining the network simulator LogGOPSim and the CPU simulator gem5. We implement offloaded
message matching, datatype processing, and collective communications and demonstrate transparent full-application speedups. Furthermore, we show how sPIN can be used to accelerate redundant
in-memory filesystems and several other use cases. Our work investigates a portable packet-processing network acceleration model
similar to compute acceleration with CUDA or OpenCL. We show
how such network acceleration enables an eco-system that can
significantly speed up applications and system services.
