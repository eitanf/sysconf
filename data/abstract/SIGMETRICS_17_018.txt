anonymity for its users, it enjoys a public perception of being a privacy-preserving financial system. In reality, cryptocurrencies
publish users’ entire transaction histories in plaintext, albeit under a pseudonym; this is required for transaction validation.
Therefore, if a user’s pseudonym can be linked to their human identity, the privacy fallout can be significant. Recently,
researchers have demonstrated deanonymization attacks that exploit weaknesses in the Bitcoin network’s peer-to-peer (P2P)
networking protocols. In particular, the P2P network currently forwards content in a structured way that allows observers
to deanonymize users. In this work, we redesign the P2P network from first principles with the goal of providing strong,
provable anonymity guarantees. We propose a simple networking policy called DANDELION which provides quasi-optimal,
network-wide anonymity, with minimal cost to the network’s utility. We also discuss practical implementation challenges
and propose heuristic solutions.
