
Estimating cascade size and nodes’ influence is a fundamental task in social, technological, and biological networks. Yet
this task is extremely challenging due to the sheer size and the structural heterogeneity of networks. We investigate a new
influence measure, termed outward influence (OJ), defined as the (expected) number of nodes that a subset of nodes S will
activate, excluding the nodes in S. Thus, OI equals, the de facto standard measure, influence spread of S minus |S|. OI is not
only more informative for nodes with small influence, but also, critical in designing new effective sampling and statistical
estimation methods,

Based on OI, we propose SIEA/SOIEA, novel methods to estimate influence spread/outward influence at scale and with
rigorous theoretical guarantees. The proposed methods are built on two novel components 1) IICP an important sampling
method for outward influence; and 2) RSA, a robust mean estimation method that minimize the number of samples through
analyzing variance and range of random variables. Compared to the state-of-the art for influence estimation, SIEA is Q(log* n)
times faster in theory and up to several orders of magnitude faster in practice. For the first time, influence of nodes in the
networks of billions of edges can be estimated with high accuracy within a few minutes. Our comprehensive experiments on
real-world networks also give evidence against the popular practice of using a fixed number, e.g. 10K or 20K, of samples to
compute the “ground truth” for influence spread.
