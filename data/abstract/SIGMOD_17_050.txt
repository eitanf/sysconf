excellent performance when processing massive volume of on-line
transactions on modern multi-core machines. But existing durability schemes, namely, tuple-level and transaction-level logging-andrecovery mechanisms, either degrade the performance of transaction processing or slow down the process of failure recovery. In
this paper, we show that, by exploiting application semantics, it is
possible to achieve speedy failure recovery without introducing any
costly logging overhead to the execution of concurrent transactions.
We propose PACMAN, a parallel database recovery mechanism that
is specifically designed for lightweight, coarse-grained transactionlevel logging. PACMAN leverages a combination of static and dynamic analyses to parallelize the log recovery: at compile time,
PACMAN decomposes stored procedures by carefully analyzing dependencies within and across programs; at recovery time, PACMAN
exploits the availability of the runtime parameter values to attain
an execution schedule with a high degree of parallelism. As such,
recovery performance is remarkably increased. We evaluated PACMAN ina fully-fledged main-memory DBMS running on a 40-core
machine. Compared to several state-of-the-art database recovery
mechanisms, PACMAN can significantly reduce recovery time without compromising the efficiency of transaction processing.
