we change this paradigm in an approximate query processing (AQP)
context. We make the following observation: the answer to each
query reveals some degree of knowledge about the answer to another
query because their answers stem from the same underlying distribution that has produced the entire dataset. Exploiting and refining
this knowledge should allow us to answer queries more analytically,
rather than by reading enormous amounts of raw data. Also, processing more queries should continuously enhance our knowledge
of the underlying distribution, and hence lead to increasingly faster
response times for future queries.

We call this novel idea—learning from past query answers—
Database Learning. We exploit the principle of maximum entropy
to produce answers, which are in expectation guaranteed to be more
accurate than existing sample-based approximations. Empowered
by this idea, we build a query engine on top of Spark SQL, called
Verdict. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world query
traces from a large customer of a major database vendor. Our results
demonstrate that Verdict supports 73.7% of these queries, speeding
them up by up to 23.0x for the same accuracy level compared to
existing AQP systems.
