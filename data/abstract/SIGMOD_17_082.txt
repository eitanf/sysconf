index creation, sort-merge joins, and user-requested output
sorting. As GPUs are emerging as a promising platform
to accelerate various operations, sorting on GPUs becomes
a viable endeavour. Over the past few years, several improvements have been proposed for sorting on GPUs, leading to the first radix sort implementations that achieve a
sorting rate of over one billion 32-bit keys per second. Yet,
state-of-the-art approaches are heavily memory bandwidthbound, as they require substantially more memory transfers
than their CPU-based counterparts. Our work proposes a
novel approach that almost halves the amount of memory
transfers and, therefore, considerably lifts the memory bandwidth limitation. Being able to sort two gigabytes of eightbyte records in as little as 50 milliseconds, our approach
achieves a 2.32-fold improvement over the state-of-the-art
GPU-based radix sort for uniform distributions, sustaining
a minimum speed-up of no less than a factor of 1.66 for
skewed distributions. To address inputs that either do not
reside on the GPU or exceed the available device memory, we
build on our efficient GPU sorting approach with a pipelined
heterogeneous sorting algorithm that mitigates the overhead
associated with PCle data transfers. Comparing the end-toend sorting performance to the state-of-the-art CPU-based
radix sort running 16 threads, our heterogeneous approach
achieves a 2.06-fold and a 1.53-fold improvement for sorting
64 GB key-value pairs with a skewed and a uniform distribution, respectively.
