run multiple versions of a continuously developed application
concurrently, it is hard to do the same for databases. In order
to keep multiple co-existing schema versions alive—which are
all accessing the same data set—developers usually employ
handwritten delta code (e.g. views and triggers in SQL).
This delta code is hard to write and hard to maintain: if a
database administrator decides to adapt the physical table
schema, all handwritten delta code needs to be adapted as
well, which is expensive and error-prone in practice. In this
paper, we present INVERDA: developers use the simple bidirectional database evolution language BIDEL, which carries
enough information to generate all delta code automatically.
Without additional effort, new schema versions become immediately accessible and data changes in any version are
visible in all schema versions at the same time. INVERDA
also allows for easily changing the physical table design without affecting the availability of co-existing schema versions.
This greatly increases robustness (orders of magnitude less
lines of code) and allows for significant performance optimization. A main contribution is the formal evaluation that
each schema version acts like a common full-fledged database
schema independently of the chosen physical table design.
