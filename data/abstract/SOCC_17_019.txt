executes dozens of highly heterogeneous tasks. Such colocation
results in more efficient utilization of machines, but, when tasks’
requirements exceed available resources, some of the tasks might
be throttled down or preempted. We analyze version 2.1 of the
Google cluster trace that shows short-term (1 second) task CPU
usage. Contrary to the assumptions taken by many theoretical
studies, we demonstrate that the empirical distributions do not
follow any single distribution. However, high percentiles of the total
processor usage (summed over at least 10 tasks) can be reasonably
estimated by the Gaussian distribution. We use this result for a
probabilistic fit test, called the Gaussian Percentile Approximation
(GPA), for standard bin-packing algorithms. To check whether a
new task will fit into a machine, GPA checks whether the resulting
distribution’s percentile corresponding to the requested service
level objective, SLO is still below the machine’s capacity. In our
simulation experiments, GPA resulted in colocations exceeding the
machines’ capacity with a frequency similar to the requested SLO.
