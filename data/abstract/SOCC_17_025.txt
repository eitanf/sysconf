greatly improve the performance of a deployed system under certain workloads. But with tens or hundreds of parameters, it becomes a highly costly task to decide which configuration setting
leads to the best performance. While such task requires the strong
expertise in both the system and the application, users commonly
lack such expertise.

To help users tap the performance potential of systems, we present
BestConfig, a system for automatically finding a best configuration setting within a resource limit for a deployed system under a
given application workload. BestConfig is designed with an extensible architecture to automate the configuration tuning for general
systems. To tune system configurations within a resource limit,
we propose the divide-and-diverge sampling method and the recursive bound-and-search algorithm. BestConfig can improve the
throughput of Tomcat by 75%, that of Cassandra by 63%, that of
MySQL by 430%, and reduce the running time of Hive join job by
about 50% and that of Spark join job by about 80%, solely by configuration adjustment.
