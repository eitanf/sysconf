includes data sources and the transformations that have been applied
to them. Data provenance has many uses, from forensics and security
to aiding the reproducibility of scientific experiments. We present
CamFlow, a whole-system provenance capture mechanism that integrates easily into a PaaS offering. While there have been several prior
whole-system provenance systems that captured a comprehensive,
systemic and ubiquitous record of a system’s behavior, none have
been widely adopted. They either A) impose too much overhead, B)
are designed for long-outdated kernel releases and are hard to port
to current systems, C) generate too much data, or D) are designed
for a single system. CamFlow addresses these shortcoming by: 1)
leveraging the latest kernel design advances to achieve efficiency; 2)
using a self-contained, easily maintainable implementation relying
on a Linux Security Module, NetFilter, and other existing kernel facilities; 3) providing a mechanism to tailor the captured provenance
data to the needs of the application; and 4) making it easy to integrate
provenance across distributed systems. The provenance we capture
is streamed and consumed by tenant-built auditor applications. We
illustrate the usability of our implementation by describing three
such applications: demonstrating compliance with data regulations;
performing fault/intrusion detection; and implementing data loss
prevention. We also show how CamFlow can be leveraged to capture
meaningful provenance without modifying existing applications.
