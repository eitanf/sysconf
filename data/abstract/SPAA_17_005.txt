in a scaling regime where efficiency is limited by data movement.
We introduce a parallel algorithm for computing the eigenvalues
of a dense symmetric matrix, which performs asymptotically less
communication than previously known approaches. We provide
analysis in the Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP) model with additional consideration for communication between a local memory and cache. Given sufficient memory to store c copies of the
symmetric matrix, our algorithm requires @(-c) less interprocessor communication than previously known algorithms, for any
c < p'/3 when using p processors. The algorithm first reduces the
dense symmetric matrix to a banded matrix with the same eigenvalues. Subsequently, the algorithm employs successive reduction to
O(log p) thinner banded matrices. We employ two new parallel algorithms that achieve lower communication costs for the full-to-band
and band-to-band reductions. Both of these algorithms leverage a
novel OR factorization algorithm for rectangular matrices.
