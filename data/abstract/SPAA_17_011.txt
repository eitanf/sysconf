over a shared set of distributed resources. Such a computation
completes when all of its flows complete. A useful abstraction for
modeling such scenarios is a coflow, which is a collection of flows
(e.g., tasks, packets, data transmissions) that all share the same
performance goal.

In this paper, we present the first approximation algorithms for
scheduling coflows over general network topologies with the objective of minimizing total weighted completion time. We consider two
different models for coflows based on the nature of individual flows:
circuits, and packets. We design constant-factor polynomial-time
approximation algorithms for scheduling packet-based coflows with
or without given flow paths, and circuit-based coflows with given
flow paths. Furthermore, we give an O(log n/log log n)-approximation
polynomial time algorithm for scheduling circuit-based coflows
without given flow paths (here n is the number of network edges).

We obtain our results by developing a general framework for
coflow schedules, based on interval-indexed linear programs, which
may extend to other coflow models and objective functions and may
also yield improved approximation bounds for specific network scenarios. We also present an experimental evaluation of our approach
for circuit-based coflows that show a performance improvement of
at least %22 on average over competing heuristics.
