design for distributed data, largely due to the fact that massive
datasets are often collected and stored in different locations. In the
distributed setting communication typically dominates the query
processing time. Thus it becomes crucial to design communication
efficient algorithms for queries on distributed data. Simultaneously,
it has been widely recognized that partial optimizations, where
we are allowed to disregard a small part of the data, provide us
significantly better solutions. The motivation for disregarded points
often arise from noise and other phenomena that are pervasive in
large data scenarios.

In this paper we focus on partial clustering problems, k-center,
k-median and k-means, in the distributed model, and provide algorithms with communication sublinear of the input size. As a consequence we develop the first algorithms for the partial k-median and
means objectives that run in subquadratic running time. We also
initiate the study of distributed algorithms for clustering uncertain
data, where each data point can possibly fall into multiple locations
under certain probability distribution.
