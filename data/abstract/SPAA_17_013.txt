a number of applications in algorithm design, machine learning,
data mining, and analysis of social networks. Over the past decades,
researchers have proposed a number of algorithmic design methods
for graph clustering. However, most of these methods are based
on complicated spectral techniques or convex optimisation, and
cannot be applied directly for clustering many networks that occur
in practice, whose information is often collected on different sites.
Designing a simple and distributed clustering algorithm is of great
interest, and has wide applications for processing big datasets.

In this paper we present a simple and distributed algorithm
for graph clustering: for a wide class of graphs that are characterised by a strong cluster-structure, our algorithm finishes in a
poly-logarithmic number of rounds, and recovers a partition of the
graph close to an optimal partition. The main component of our
algorithm is an application of the random matching model of load
balancing, which is a fundamental protocol in distributed computing and has been extensively studied in the past 20 years. Hence, our
result highlights an intrinsic and interesting connection between
graph clustering and load balancing.

At a technical level, we present a purely algebraic result characterising the early behaviours of load balancing processes for graphs
exhibiting a cluster-structure. We believe that this result can be
further applied to analyse other gossip processes, such as rumour
spreading and averaging processes.
