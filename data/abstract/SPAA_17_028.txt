component of several wireless standards.

Despite this track record, prior theoretical results indicate that
under bursty traffic (1) BEB yields poor makespan and (2) superior
algorithms are possible. To date, the degree to which these findings
manifest in practice has not been resolved.

To address this issue, we examine one of the strongest cases
against BEB: n packets that simultaneously begin contending for
the wireless channel. Using Network Simulator 3, we compare
against more recent algorithms that are inspired by BEB, but whose
makespan guarantees are superior. Surprisingly, we discover that
these newer algorithms significantly underperform.

Through further investigation, we identify as the culprit a flawed
but common abstraction regarding the cost of collisions. Our experimental results are complemented by analytical arguments that the
number of collisions — and not solely makespan — is an important
metric to optimize. We argue that these findings have implications
for the design of contention-resolution algorithms.
