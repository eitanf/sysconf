
We present MemEC, an erasure-coding-based in-memory
key-value (KV) store that achieves high availability and fast
recovery while keeping low data redundancy across storage
servers. MemEC is specifically designed for workloads dominated by small objects. By encoding objects in entirety,
MemEC is shown to incur 60% less storage redundancy for
small objects than existing replication- and erasure-codingbased approaches. It also supports graceful transitions between decentralized requests in normal mode (i.e., no failures) and coordinated requests in degraded mode (i.e., with
failures). We evaluate our MemEC prototype via testbed experiments under read-heavy and update-heavy YCSB workloads. We show that MemEC achieves high throughput and
low latency in both normal and degraded modes, and supports fast transitions between the two modes.
