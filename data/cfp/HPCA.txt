The International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture provides a high-quality forum for scientists and engineers to present their latest research findings in this rapidly-changing field. Authors are invited to submit papers on all aspects of high-performance computer architecture. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

– Processor, cache, and memory architectures
– Parallel computer architectures
– Multicore and multiprocessor architectures
– Impact of technology on architecture
– Power-efficient architectures and techniques
– Dependable/secure architectures
– High-performance I/O systems
– Embedded, reconfigurable, and heterogeneous architectures
– Interconnect and network interface architectures
– Architectures for cloud-based HPC and data centers
– Innovative hardware/software trade-offs
– Impact of compilers and system software on architecture
– Performance modeling and evaluation
– Architectures for emerging technology and applications

Authors should submit an abstract by July 25, 2016 11:59 PM CDT. They should submit the full version of the paper August 1, 2016, 11:59 PM CDT. No extensions will be granted. The full version should be a PDF file following the submission guidelines that will be made available at the submission website. Papers should be submitted for blind review. We anticipate making a Best Paper award; all papers will be evaluated based on their novelty, fundamental insights, experimental evaluation, and potential for long-term impact. New-idea papers as well as papers that significantly advance established areas are strongly encouraged. Submission issues should be directed to the program chair at djimenez@cse.tamu.edu . Details formatting and submission guidelines will be made available at http://hpca23.cse.tamu.edu .  HPCA-23 will host an Industrial Paper Session presenting novel insights from industry. See the HPCA 2017 website for submission details.

Important dates:
– Abstract submission: July 25, 2016, 11:59 PM CDT (firm deadline)
– Paper submission: August 1, 2016, 11:59 PM CDT (firm deadline)
– Notification of paper outcome: October 12, 2016
