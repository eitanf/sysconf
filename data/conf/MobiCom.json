    "notes": "There was a heavy PC and light PC (30 members each). The smaller size of the heavy PC allowed for a more manageable PC peeting, and allowed the members of the light committee to remain involved, but with a lighter load. TPC selection took into account gender, seniority, institution, country, expertise, and academic/industrial background. Review took three phases: 1st, at least three reviews, with the top 107 papers advancing to phase 2 (taking into account not only score but also reviewer confidence and normalizing for reviewer scoring of other papers). In the second phase, 2+ more reviews written per paper, followed by an online discussion, producing 68 papers for the TPC meeting (phase 3). The light PC participated only in the first phase. Each of the accepted 35 papers were shepherded, which served to clarify and improve the paper (not for additional experiments). Included below are two shoerter (8 page) experience papers. Verification papers were also solicited, but none were submitted. The first paper (Webee) appears to be a demo paper, but shows up as a regular paper in the ACM TOC. Diversity: N2Women fellowship, harrassment policy.",
