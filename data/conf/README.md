The JSON files under the `data/conf/` directory hold information about each conference (one per file, with the filename being the short conference name). The data was copied from the conferences' web pages, with supplemental information from the CFP, the proceedings and its frontmatter, and sometimes directory from program chairs.

Empty fields (where not data was available or applicable) are denoted as empty strings or lists, according to the field's type.

Some conferences from fields other than 'Systems' are mostly empty, collecting only minimal author information.

### Field description {-}

* `conference` (string): Full conference name.
* `url` (string): the URL of the main page for the conference.
* `ogranization` (list of categorical strings): List of organizations sponsonring the event (only IEEE/ACM/USENIX are recorded since the rest are too infrequent to provide useful signal).
* `country` (two-letter categorical string): Country code where conference took place.
* `postdate` (date): First day of technical program.
* `last_deadline` (date): The last date when author could upload the full version of their paper for review (before rebuttals and revisions).
* `review_days` (int): The number of days between full paper submission due date and author notification.
* `mean_pages` (numeric): Average number of pages in the PDF versions of accepted papers.
* `submissions` (int): Total number of papers submitted for review. Papers rejected outright for formatting violations are not counted.
* `min_reviews` (int): The minimum number of reviews received by each paper.
* `total_reviews` (int): The total number of formal reviews written by the PC, overall.
* `double_blind` (bool): Whether the review process was double-blind, i.e., author identities were hidden.
* `rebuttal` (bool): Were authors afforded an opportunity to answer the reviews before final acceptance decision was made?
* `open_access` (bool): Whether conference is open access. Are all papers freely available to download?
* `age` (int): Approximate age (in years) of this conference series (trying to account for splits and mergers).
* `past_papers` (int): How many papers were published in this series prior to 2017. This datum was either taken from the ACM digital library, IEEE Xplore, or counted manually.
* `past_citations` (int): How many total citations have papers in this series received, at approximately the postdate. This information was also copied from ACM digital library or IEEE Xplore, where available. Note, however, that because of differences in methods of citation counting, they are likely not directly comparable to each other or to Google Scholar's count.
* `h5_index` (int): The "H-index" of the conference in the past 5 years, taken from Google Scholar Metrics, where available, at approximately the postdate.
* `h5_median (int)`: The median number of citations for papers in the h5 set, taken from Google Scholar Metrics, where available, at approximately the postdate.
 * `scopus_metrics` (dictionary): A collection of metrics from Scopus on this year's conference:
    - `citations` (int): Total citations to date.
    - `pct_cited` (number): The proprotion of the document that have been cited at least once.
    - `citeScore` (number): Mean citations per document in this conference.
    - `SNIP` (number): Source-normalized impact per paper--citations per paper relative to the exected citations in the field.
    - `SJR` (number): SCImago journal rank--conference citations weighted by subject field and prestige.
    - `percentile` (int): citeScore relative ranking in subject field.
 * `field` (categorical string): The top-level category of the conference's topic.
 * `subfield` categorical string): The top-ocurring topic of interest for this conference (selected from `topics.json` for systems conferences).
* `diversity_effort` (bool): Did the conference website describe some effort to improve diversity (with details in the `notes` field).
* `notes` (string): free-form text with comments on the review proccess, if applicatible.
* `pc_chairs` (list of strings): Name(s) of the Program Committe (PC) chairs and their affiliations
* `pc_members` (list of strings): Names of the PC members and their affiliations.
* `keynote_speakers` (list of strings): Names of keynote (or invited) speakers.
* `session_chairs` (list of strings): Names of session chairs copied from the program (with repeats).
* `panelists` (list of strings): Names of panelists and moderators of panels.
* papers (list of dictionaries): Accepted peer-reviewed papers. For each paper, the following data were recorded:
    - `key` (string): A unique identifier combining the conference name and the paper's ordinal number.
    - `title` (string): Paper title, copied from the conference web page
    - `authors` (list of strings): Author names, and sometimes affiliation in parenthesis. The affiliation wasn't used for any features or training, but rather to help disambiguate among multiple scholar profiles with the same name, as described in the next section.
    - `award` (bool): Did the paper receive an award, such as "Best Paper" or "Best Student Paper"?
    - `s2pid` (hexadecimal string)`: An identifier for the paper in semanticscholar.org.
    - `words` (int): Approximate number of words in the paper (wc of text file).
    - `topics` (list of categorical strings): List of keywords (see `topics.csv` for full list). These are high-level topics that roughly correspond to undergraduate courses in computer systems, such as "Operating Systems", "Networking", or "Security". They were manually assigned, and as such, likely include some errors, misrepresentations, and ommisions. Each topic had at least one conference focused primarily on this topic, although multi-topic papers are common. The following table lists the topic selection that was used.
    - `content_tags` (dictionary of lists of categorical strings): List of research categories for the paper, taken from `data/content_tags.json` (currently all are manually assigned).
    - `artifact` (dictionary): A collection of fields describing software or data artifact (only when available or evaluated), as follow:
      - `badge` (bool): Did the paper receive an "artifacts available" or similar seal? (primarily [ACM papers](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging)).
      - `evaluated` (bool): Did the paper receive an "artifacts evaluated" or similar seal? (primarily [ACM papers](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging)).
      - `linked` (bool): Was the artifact linked to from the paper?
      - `url` (string): URL from the paper or elsewhere. An empty string means an artifact was ostensibly never made openly available (only evaluated).
      - `last_accessed` (date): Last date that the URL/DOI was tested and found accessibile (empty string if never, "NA" if it couldn't be found).
