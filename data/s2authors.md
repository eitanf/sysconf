This file is a simple mapping from author ID to the count of how many papers
this author appeared in, in the Semantic Scholar DB dump dated 2018-05-03.

### Field description

  * `name` (string): Un-normalized author name (first, last).
  * `gs_email` (string): Author email suffix on Google Scholar.
  * `s2aid` (integer): Author ID on Semantic Scholar, based on our dataset.
  * `s2npubs` (integer): No. of times this author ID showed up in the DB dump.

### Provenance and methodology

The file was generated with the following sequence of python scripts:

#### Generate counts of all author IDs

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
#
# Read in a JSON data file with a mapping from Semantic Scholar (S2) author IDs
# to counts.
# Read in one or more S2 JSON DB files from the command line arguments,
# then increment the counts of all the author IDs that appear in the file(s)
# and save back the data file.

import sys
from shared_utils import *

counts_fn = "/data/sda/semanticscholar/s2authors-all.json";

counts = load_json_file(counts_fn, False)

for fn in sys.argv[1:]:
    print("Working on: ", fn)
    s2 = load_json_file(fn)
    for paper in s2:
        for author in paper["authors"]:
            if 'ids' in author and len(author['ids']) > 0:
                sid = author['ids'][0]
                if sid not in counts:
                    counts[sid] = 0
                counts[sid] += 1

    save_json_file(counts_fn, counts)
```

#### Find S2 author ID of our authors

The actual S2 author ID of each author can be discovered using this script:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
#
# This script reads in a conference JSON file and author profile file. It adds
# or updates author profile files with their S2 author ID.
# total citation count.

from shared_utils import *
import editdistance

######### main

if len(sys.argv) != 2:
    print("Required argument: conference name")
    exit(1)

conf = sys.argv[1]
confdata = load_json_file(data_fn('conf', conf))
authordata = load_json_file(data_fn('authors', conf), False)
s2papers = load_json_file("data/s2papers.json")
s2authors = load_csv_file("data/s2authors.csv", False)

            s2_entry['s2aid'] = aid

        save_data(s2authors)
```

#### Add publication counts to author ID data

The actual publication counts can then be added with the following code:

```python
from shared_utils import *

s2authors = load_csv_file("data/s2authors.csv")
counts = load_json_file("/tmp/s2authors-all.json")

for r in s2authors:
    if r['s2aid'] in counts:
        r['s2npubs'] = counts[r['s2aid']]

with open("data/s2authors.csv", "w", encoding='utf-8') as f:
        writer = csv.DictWriter(f, fieldnames = ["name", "gs_email", "s2aid", "s2npubs"])
        writer.writeheader()
        writer.writerows(s2authors)
```

#### Complement counts by names

Finally, there are still some missing counts, because of mistmatched names/IDs. To resolve these, the following script searches by exact name match only. It's very slow.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
#
# Read in a JSON data file with a mapping from Semantic Scholar (S2) author IDs
# to counts.
# For any missing author count, look up the name in all S2 JSON files using
# grep, and count them.

import glob
import subprocess
from shared_utils import *

authors = load_csv_file("data/s2authors.csv")

for r in authors:
    if r['s2npubs'] == "":
        print("Working on", r['name'])
        r['s2npubs'] = subprocess.check_output(["/bin/fgrep", r['name']] +
               glob.glob("/data/sda/semanticscholar/*.json")). \
                       decode('utf-8'). \
                       count('\n')
        print("Found", r['s2npubs'], "entries")

        with open("data/s2authors.csv", "w", encoding='utf-8') as f:
            writer = csv.DictWriter(f, fieldnames = ["name", "gs_email", "s2aid", "s2npubs"])
            writer.writeheader()
            writer.writerows(authors)
```
