  abstract =	 {Background Although there has been a continuous
                  increase in the number of women working in the field
                  of medicine, women rarely reach the highest academic
                  positions as full professors or editorial board
                  members.  Objective We aimed to determine the
                  proportion of women on the editorial boards of
                  top-ranked medical journals in different medical
                  specialties.  Methods We analyzed the gender of
                  editorial board members of 60 top-ranked journals of
                  12 Thomson Reuters Web of Knowledge Journal Citation
                  Reports categories. A total of 4175 editors were
                  included in our analysis.  Results Only 15.9% (10 of
                  63) editors-in-chief were female. In the 5
                  categories, critical care, anesthesiology,
                  orthopedics, ophthalmology and radiology, nuclear
                  medicine and medical imaging, currently not 1 woman
                  holds the position of editor-in-chief. Less than one
                  fifth (17.5%, 719 of 4112) of all editorial board
                  members were women. There were significant
                  differences among the evaluated categories, with the
                  highest percentage of women in the category of
                  medicine, general and internal and the lowest in the
                  category critical care, followed by orthopedics. In
                  every category, the proportion of women as editorial
                  board members was substantially lower than that of
                  men.  Conclusions Women are underrepresented on the
                  editorial boards of major medical journals, although
                  there is a great variability among the journals and
                  categories analyzed. If more women are nominated to
                  serve on editorial boards, they will be a visible
                  sign of continuing progress and serve as important
                  role models for young women contemplating a career
                  in academic medicine.}

                  to identify the factors that affect this
                  underrepresentation worldwide. This literature
                  review covers 470 papers—published in journals with
                  the highest impact factor from 1985 to 2018—that
                  address the factors that influence the access,
                  participation, and progress of women in scientific
                  careers. This literature review was based on the
                  complete readings of the papers using thematic
                  analysis. The factors that influence women’s access,
                  participation and progress in careers related to
                  science and technology are a complex problem with
                  multiple interdependent factors. In addition, these
                  vary according to the stages of women’s lives and
                  cultural contexts. This paper proposes, based on the
                  literature review, a comprehensive framework to
                  explain the factors that influence the access,
                  participation, and progress of women in science
                  careers. The factors are grouped as follows: (a)
                  individual, (b) family, (c) social, (d) educational,
                  and (e) labor-economic. The proposed research is
                  useful for researchers and policy makers because it
                  introduces this phenomenon schematically and orderly
                  identifies the gaps in past research studies, and
                  evidences the need to conduct further research on
                  this topic.}

                  techniques. Several studies have reported
                  complementary results with gender disparity in
                  authorship of scholarly publications.  However, the
                  reported results vary according to objectives of the

                  authorships, 2) data and techniques used for
                  detection of author’s gender need more geographic

                  regression model (LRM) with a total of 1,745
                  manuscripts was used.  In addition to bias
                  variables, an indicator (measured ex-post) for the
                  scientific impact of a manuscript was taken into
                  account.  The results of the ORMs show that the
                  number of institutions mentioned in the
                  Acknowledgements of a manuscript, the share of
                  authors having institutional affiliations in
                  Germany, the institutional address of the referee
                  (in Germany or not in Germany), and ‘author
                  suggested a referee for the manuscript’ have
                  statistically significant effects on the referees’
                  recommendations. The LRM shows that the number of
                  institutions that are mentioned in the
                  Acknowledgements and the share of authors having
                  institutional affiliations in Germany are potential
                  sources of bias in the editors’ decisions.}

                  research collaboration patterns and strategies? This
                  straightforward question does not lend itself to a
                  straightforward answer. A great many sex-correlated
                  variables could possibly mitigate the relationship
                  of sex and collaboration. If one finds
                  sex-correlated differences in the number of
                  collaborators, can one infer that there is something
                  intrinsic to men's and women's work strategies and
                  preferences? Or would such differences owe instead
                  to women's and men's different positions in work
                  structures and hierarchies? The focus here is on two
                  sets of research collaboration variables, numbers of
                  collaborators and the collaboration strategies
                  employed. The study uses questionnaire data from the
                  U.S. National Survey of Academic Scientists (n =
                  1714) and tests several hypotheses about
                  collaboration numbers and strategies. Regression
                  results indicate, counter to the core hypotheses and
                  almost all published literature, that in a properly
                  specified model, one taking into account such
                  factors as tenure, discipline, family status and
                  doctoral cohort, women actually have somewhat more
                  collaborators on average than do men. For both men
                  and women, those with more industrial interactions
                  and those affiliated with university research
                  centers have more collaborators. Men and women
                  differ in their collaborator choice strategies. Men
                  are more likely to be oriented to “instrumental,”
                  and “experience” strategies, while both men and
                  women are motivated by “mentoring”
                  strategies. Regression analyses show that for both
                  men and women, having a coherent collaborator choice
                  strategy predicts the number of collaborators.}

  abstract =	 {Explanations for women’s underrepresentation in
                  math-intensive fields of science often focus on sex
                  discrimination in grant and manuscript reviewing,
                  interviewing, and hiring. Claims that women
                  scientists suffer discrimination in these arenas
                  rest on a set of studies undergirding policies and
                  programs aimed at remediation. More recent and
                  robust empiricism, however, fails to support
                  assertions of discrimination in these domains. To
                  better understand women’s underrepresentation in
                  math-intensive fields and its causes, we reprise
                  claims of discrimination and their evidentiary
                  bases. Based on a review of the past 20 years of
                  data, we suggest that some of these claims are no
                  longer valid and, if uncritically accepted as
                  current causes of women’s lack of progress, can
                  delay or prevent understanding of contemporary
                  determinants of women’s underrepresentation. We
                  conclude that differential gendered outcomes in the
                  real world result from differences in resources
                  attributable to choices, whether free or
                  constrained, and that such choices could be
                  influenced and better informed through education if
                  resources were so directed. Thus, the ongoing focus
                  on sex discrimination inreviewing, and hiring
                  represents costly, misplaced effort: Society is
                  engaged in the present in solving problems of the
                  past, rather than in addressing meaningful
                  limitations deterring women’s participation in
                  science, technology, engineering, andmathematics
                  careers today. Addressing today’s causes of
                  underrep-resentation requires focusing on education
                  and policy changesthat will make institutions
                  responsive to differing biological reali-ties of the
                  sexes. Finally, we suggest potential avenues of
                  intervention to increase gender fairness that accord
                  with current, asopposed to historical,findings.},

                  far from immune, although it should be easier for CS
                  than other sciences, given the emphasis on
                  experimental artifacts, such as source code, data
                  sets, workflows, parameters, etc. The data
                  management community pioneered methods at ACM SIGMOD
                  2007 and 2008 to encourage and incentivize authors
                  to improve their software development and
                  experimental practices. Now, after 10 years, the
                  broader CS community has started to adopt Artifact
                  Evaluation (AE) to review artifacts along with
                  papers. In this paper, we examine how AE has
                  incentivized authors, and whether the process is
                  having a measurable impact. Our answer can help
                  guide CS, and more broadly, other
                  computationally-oriented sciences, in encouraging
                  peer-review of software artifacts and developing
                  additional community practices for incentives.}

  abstract =	 {Peer review is the ordinary method for judging the
                  acceptability of scientific papers for
                  publication. Yet there are few prospective data
                  defining the accuracy or reproducibility of this
                  method. This study was aimed at evaluating
                  interrater consistency in reviewing a single
                  manuscript and at determining whether a referee's
                  likely predisposition (inferred from his or her own
                  published papers in the field) influences his or her
                  attitude toward this manuscript. A computerized
                  search identified 33 first authors of research
                  papers about transcutaneous electrical nerve
                  stimulation. They were asked to review part of a
                  fictitious scientific paper on the topic; they were
                  not made aware of being tested. Reviewers' ratings
                  were recorded by multiple-choice answers in a
                  structured questionnaire. The analyses of the
                  answers revealed poor interrater
                  reliability. Furthermore, referees were clearly
                  influenced by their own preconceptions and judged
                  according to their own published experience in that
                  particular medical subject. That is, referees who
                  would be expected to agree with the paper's findings
                  tended to judge it less harshly than did referees
                  who would be expected to disagree. These results
                  suggest significant impact of reviewer bias on
                  referees' judgment and imply that the peer review
                  system in its present form has room for improvements
                  in fairness and consistency.},

                  author identity are biased in favor of authors with
                  more previous publications.  Design: Randomized
                  controlled trial.  Setting: Editorial office of the
                  Journal of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics.
                  Participants: Two "blinded" and two "nonblinded"
                  reviewers assigned to 57 consecutive manuscripts
                  submitted between September 1991 and March 1992.
                  Outcome measures: Spearman rank correlation
                  coefficients were used to compare the sum of rating
                  scores of 1 to 5 (1, accept; 5, reject) given by the
                  two blinded reviewers, the two nonblinded reviewers,
                  and the editors to the number of articles published
                  previously by the first and senior authors (as
                  determined from requested curricula vitae). Blinded
                  reviewers were sent a questionnaire asking whether
                  they could determine the identity of the authors,
                  how they knew, and whether they thought binding
                  changed the quality or difficulty of their review.
                  Results: The Wilcoxon Sign Rank Test disclosed no
                  differences between blinded and nonblinded
                  scores. The number of previous articles by the
                  senior author was significantly correlated (P < .01)
                  with blinded scores (r = -.45) and editors'
                  decisions (r = -.45), but not with nonblinded
                  scores; the number of articles by the first author
                  was correlated (P < .05) with editors' decisions (r
                  = -.35) but not with blinded or nonblinded
                  scores. Fifty (46\%) of 108 blinded reviewers
                  correctly guessed the identity of the authors,
                  mostly from self-references and knowledge of the
                  work; 86\% believed blinding did not change the
                  quality of their review, and 73\% believed it did
                  not change the difficulty of performing a review.
                  Conclusions: Blinded reviewers and editors in this
                  study, but not nonblinded reviewers, gave better
                  scores to authors with more previous articles. These
                  results suggest that blinded reviewers may provide
                  more unbiased reviews and that nonblinded reviewers
                  may be affected by various types of bias.}

  abstract =	 {1.There is a widespread perception in the academic
                  community that peer review is subject to many biases
                  and can be influenced by the identity and biographic
                  features (such as gender) ofmanuscript authors.2.We
                  examined how patterns of authorship differ between
                  men and women, and whetherauthor gender influences
                  editorial and peer review outcomes and/or the peer
                  review process forpapers submitted to the
                  journalFunctional Ecologybetween 2010 and
                  2014.3.Women represented approximately a third of
                  all authors on papers submitted
                  toFunctionalEcology. Relative to overall frequency
                  of authorship, women were underrepresented as
                  soloauthors (26\% were women). On multi-authored
                  papers, women were also underrepresented
                  aslast/senior authors (25\% were women) but
                  overrepresented as first authors (43\% were
                  women).Women first authors were less likely than men
                  first authors to serve as corresponding and
                  sub-mitting author of their papers; this difference
                  was not influenced by the gender of the
                  lastauthor. Women were more likely to be authors on
                  papers if the last author was female.4.Papers with
                  female authors (i) were equally likely to be sent
                  for peer review, (ii) obtainedequivalent peer review
                  scores and (iii) were equally likely to be accepted
                  for publication, com-pared to papers with male
                  authors. There was no evidence that male editors or
                  male reviewerstreated papers authored by women
                  differently than did female editors and reviewers,
                  and noevidence that more senior editors reached
                  different decisions than younger editors after
                  review,or cumulative through the entire process, for
                  papers authored by men vs. women.5.Papers authored
                  by women were more likely to be reviewed by
                  women. This is primarilybecause women were more
                  likely to be invited to review if the authors on a
                  paper were femalethan if the authors were
                  male.6.Patterns of authorship, and the role
                  undertaken as author (e.g., submitting and serving
                  ascorresponding author), differ notably between men
                  and women for papers submitted toFunc-tional
                  Ecology. However, consistent with a growing body of
                  literature indicating that peerreview underlying the
                  scholarly publishing process is largely
                  gender-neutral, outcomes of edito-rial and peer
                  review atFunctional Ecologywere not influenced by
                  author gender.},

                  percentages among undergraduate majors and among
                  degree recipients of four basic factors: (1) the
                  percentage of faculty who are women in the students'
                  major science/engineering area; (2) the students'
                  disciplines (biology, physical sciences, and
                  engineering); (3) the type of institution in which
                  students are enrolled (“Research I” vs. others); and
                  (4) a time trend (1984–2000). Method. We use
                  longitudinal, multivariate, and multi‐institutional
                  data from the Integrated Postsecondary Data System
                  (IPEDS) and from a mail survey of
                  registrars. Results. Over the observation period,
                  the women's percentages have risen steadily. The
                  effects of disciplines and departments are stronger
                  than those of institutions. Especially notable is
                  that the percentages of women among undergraduate
                  science/engineering majors and degree recipients are
                  associated with the percentages of women among the
                  faculty in these fields. Conclusion. The findings
                  contribute empirically to the discussion about the
                  effects of “role models” for the participation and
                  performance of women in science and engineering—and
                  point to the strong effects of departments, compared
                  to institutions, in accounting for degrees awarded
                  to undergraduate women.}

                  has been little empirical research on gender

                  implementation of the science and technology (S&T)
                  policies. This article aims to present a
                  comprehensive gendered analysis of engineering
                  publications across different specialties and
                  provide a cross-gender analysis of research output
                  and scientific impact of engineering researchers in
                  academic, governmental, and industrial sectors. For
                  this purpose, 679,338 engineering articles published
                  from 2008 to 2013 are extracted from the Web of
                  Science database and 974,837 authorships are
                  analyzed. The structures of co-authorship
                  collaboration networks in different engineering
                  disciplines are examined, highlighting the role of
                  female scientists in the diffusion of knowledge. The
                  findings reveal that men dominate 80\% of all the
                  scientific production in engineering. Women
                  engineers publish their papers in journals with
                  higher Impact Factors than their male peers, but
                  their work receives lower recognition (fewer
                  citations) from the scientific
                  community. Engineers—regardless of their
                  gender—contribute to the reproduction of the
                  male-dominated scientific structures through forming
                  and repeating their collaborations predominantly
                  with men. The results of this study call for
                  integration of data driven gender-related policies

                  of the intersection of immigration and gender among
                  scientists and engineers. Methods. We use data from
                  the 5\% Public Use Microsample (PUMS) of the 1990
                  census and the longitudinal 1982-1989 Survey of
                  Natural and Social Scientists and Engineers (SSE) to
                  compare the labor force outcomes of women immigrant
                  scientists to immigrant men and native-born women
                  scientists. Results. We find that immigrant women
                  are less likely to be employed and promoted than
                  immigrant men and native-born women. Although women
                  immigrants appear to earn slightly less than
                  native-born women, this gap is explained by such
                  factors as field, employment sector, and family
                  characteristics. We suggest that immigration paths
                  may underlie some of the labor force disadvantages
                  experienced by immigrant women
                  scientists. Conclusions. The results of this paper
                  highlight the importance of considering gender
                  differences, particularly differences in migration
                  path, when studying immigrant
                  scientists. Consideration of gender leads to a
                  fuller understanding of immigrant scientists' labor
                  force outcomes.},

                  faculty at two campuses of a large public,

                  sources that, on average, women faculty perform
                  significantly more service than men, controlling for
                  rank, race/ethnicity, and field or department. Our
                  analyses suggest that the male–female differential
                  is driven more by internal service—i.e., service to
                  the university, campus, or department—than external
                  service—i.e., service to the local, national, and

                  continuum. Design Systematic comparison. Methods
                  Data were obtained from several sources for awards
                  from the period 1997 to 2010 and each study assigned

                  investment, study numbers, mean grant and median
                  grant between men and women. Results 6052 studies
                  were included in the final analysis, comprising 4357
                  grants (72\%) awarded to men and 1695 grants (28\%)
                  awarded to women, totalling {\textsterling}2.274
                  billion. Of this, men received {\textsterling}1.786
                  billion (78.5\%) and women {\textsterling}488
                  million (21.5\%). The median value of award was
                  greater for men ({\textsterling}179 389; IQR
                  {\textsterling}59 146{\textendash}{\textsterling}371
                  977) than women ({\textsterling}125 556; IQR
                  {\textsterling}30 982{\textendash}{\textsterling}261
                  834). Awards were greater for male principal
                  investigators (PIs) across all infectious disease
                  systems, excepting neurological infections and
                  sexually transmitted infections. The proportion of
                  total funding awarded to women ranged from 14.3\% in
                  1998 to 26.8\% in 2009 (mean 21.4\%), and was lowest
                  for preclinical research at 18.2\%
                  ({\textsterling}285.5 million of
                  {\textsterling}1.573 billion) and highest for
                  operational research at 30.9\% ({\textsterling}151.4
                  million of {\textsterling}489.7
                  million). Conclusions There are consistent
                  differences in funding received by men and women
                  PIs: women have fewer funded studies and receive
                  less funding in absolute and in relative terms; the
                  median funding awarded to women is lower across most
                  infectious disease areas, by funder, and type of
                  science. These differences remain broadly unchanged
                  over the 14-year study period.},

  abstract =	 {To what extent do sociologists collaborate? Has this
                  changed over time? What factors contribute to
                  research collaboration among sociologists? To answer
                  these questions, we examine trends in collaboration
                  over a 70 year period and empirically test a variety
                  of explanations for the increase in collaboration
                  that we find. We analyze data collected from a
                  stratified random sample of articles in two leading
                  sociology journals between 1935 and 2005
                  (n = 1274). Most of our analyses are descriptive and
                  display trends over time. However, we pool the data
                  across all years and estimate logistic regression
                  models to assess the relative contribution of
                  various factors. We find that the importance of
                  geographical location has been waning since the
                  1950s, although the growth in cross-place
                  collaborations stagnated between 1980 and 2005. We
                  find that quantitative research is more likely to be
                  collaborative, as are projects requiring data
                  collection, though this may change because the
                  collaboration rate among secondary data users is
                  increasing at a faster rate. We find no significant
                  gender differences in rates of collaboration,
                  although male sole-authorship remains the most
                  common form of publication. We also find the
                  institutional prestige of coauthors is typically
                  higher than that of sole-authors. Our results
                  elucidate the extent of collaboration in sociology
                  and reveal how several factors have contributed to
                  this major shift in work organization.}

  abstract =	 {Objective: To determine whether articles published
                  in journals using blinded peer review receive
                  significantly more or fewer citations than those
                  published in journals using nonblinded peer review.
                  Design: Drawing from a sample of 1051 full articles
                  published in 28 economics journals during 1984, we
                  used nonlinear regression and ordered probit
                  techniques to estimate the impact of blinded peer
                  review on citations of these articles in 1985
                  through 1989.  Outcomes: Citations of articles.
                  Results: Articles published in journals using
                  blinded peer review were cited significantly more
                  than articles published in journals using nonblinded
                  peer review, controlling for a variety of author,
                  article, and journal attributes.  Conclusions:
                  Nonblinded peer review apparently suffers from type
                  I error to a greater extent than blinded peer
                  review. That is, journals using nonblinded peer
                  review published a larger fraction of papers that
                  should not have been published than do journals
                  using blinded peer review. When reviewers know the
                  identity of the author(s) of an article, they are
                  able to (and evidently do) substitute
                  particularistic criteria for universalistic criteria
                  in their evaluative process.}

  abstract =	 {Professional societies and their conferences provide
                  an important venue for disseminating scientific
                  knowledge. Delivering a keynote for or being named a
                  fellow by an international society is a major
                  recognition. Do such recognitions reflect the
                  composition of the field of bioinformatics? We
                  compiled a list of 412 International Society for
                  Computational Biology honorees (75 fellows and 337
                  keynote speakers). To assess the composition of
                  senior researchers in the field, we analyze the
                  names and affliations of corresponding authors in
                  leading bioinformatics journals. Comparing to the
                  distribution based on names and affliations of
                  honorees, we looked for disparities in gender,
                  country of affliation, race, and
                  name-origin. Name-origin predictions were created
                  using a neural network trained on 700,000
                  name-nationality pairs mined from Wikipedia. The
                  proportion of female honorees has kept pace with
                  increasing levels of female authorship, but neither
                  has yet to reach gender parity. However, we noticed
                  a striking geographic disparity where the proportion
                  of honorees with an affliation in the United States
                  was 1.6-fold greater compared to field-specific
                  senior authors. In total, we estimate the
                  U.S. received 85 more honorees than would be
                  expected from randomly selecting honorees from
                  senior authors. Almost half of the excess in
                  U.S. honorees was accounted for by a deficit of 41
                  honoree slots from China, France, and
                  Italy. Furthermore, within the U.S., we identify
                  racial disparities with an excess of white honorees
                  and a depletion of Asian honorees. This pattern
                  replicated globally, where we find names of East
                  Asian origin have been persistently underrepresented
                  among ISCB honorees. Early indications suggest the
                  ICSB has taken note of our findings by selecting
                  more diverse honorees.Competing Interest

                  443 academic scientists affiliated with university
                  research centers in the USA, we examine the
                  longstanding assumption that research collaboration
                  has a positive effect on publishing
                  productivity. Since characteristics of the
                  individual and the work environment are endogenously
                  related to both collaboration and productivity, this
                  study focuses on the mediating effect of
                  collaboration on publishing productivity. By using
                  the two-stage least squares analysis, the findings
                  indicate that in the presence of moderating
                  variables such as age, rank, grant, gender, marital
                  status, family relations, citizenship, job
                  satisfaction, perceived discrimination, and
                  collaboration strategy, the simple number (‘normal
                  count’) of peer-reviewed journal papers is strongly
                  and significantly associated with the number of
                  collaborators. However, the net impacts of
                  collaboration are less clear. When we apply the same
                  model and examine productivity by ‘fractional
                  count’, dividing the number of publications by the
                  number of authors, we find that number of
                  collaborators is not a significant predictor of
                  publishing productivity. In both cases, ‘normal
                  count’ and ‘fractional count’, we find significant
                  effects of research grants, citizenship,
                  collaboration strategy, and scientific field. We
                  believe that it is important to understand the
                  effects of the individual and environmental factors
                  for developing effective strategies to exploit the
                  potential benefits of collaboration. We note that
                  our focus is entirely at the individual level, and
                  some of the most important benefits of collaboration
                  may accrue to groups, institutions, and scientific
                  fields.}

                  of such manuscripts is not known.  Objective.— To
                  assess whether US reviewers or non-US reviewers
                  evaluate manuscripts differently, depending on
                  whether the manuscripts are submitted from outside
                  the United States or from the United States.  Design
                  and Setting.— A retrospective analysis of all
                  original submissions received by Gastroenterology in
                  1995 and 1996. Reviewers ranked manuscripts in 4
                  decision categories: accept, provisionally accept,
                  reject with resubmission, or reject.  Main Outcome
                  Measure.— Ranking of papers based on nationality of
                  authors and reviewers.  Results.— The percentage of
                  non-US manuscripts placed in each decision category
                  by US (n=2355) and non-US reviewers (n=1297) was
                  nearly identical (P=.31). However, US reviewers
                  recommended acceptance of papers submitted by US
                  authors more often than did non-US reviewers
                  (P=.001). Non-US reviewers ranked US papers slightly
                  more favorably than non-US papers (P=.09), while US
                  reviewers ranked US papers much more favorably
                  (P=.001).  Conclusions.— Reviewers from the United
                  States and outside the United States evaluate non-US
                  papers similarly and evaluate papers submitted by US
                  authors more favorably, with US reviewers having a
                  significant preference for US papers.}

                  engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields is a
                  prominent concern in our society and many
                  others. Closer inspection of this phenomenon reveals
                  a more nuanced picture, however, with women
                  achieving parity with men at the Ph.D. level in
                  certain STEM fields, while also being
                  underrepresented in some non-STEM fields. It is
                  important to consider and provide an account of this
                  field-by-field variability. The field-specific
                  ability beliefs (FAB) hypothesis aims to provide
                  such an account, proposing that women are likely to
                  be underrepresented in fields thought to require raw
                  intellectual talent—a sort of talent that women are
                  stereotyped to possess less of than men. In two
                  studies, we provide evidence for the FAB hypothesis,
                  demonstrating that the academic fields believed by
                  laypeople to require brilliance are also the fields
                  with lower female representation. We also found that
                  the FABs of participants with college-level exposure
                  to a field were more predictive of its female
                  representation than those of participants without
                  college exposure, presumably because the former
                  beliefs mirror more closely those of the field’s
                  practitioners (the direct “gatekeepers”). Moreover,
                  the FABs of participants with college exposure to a
                  field predicted the magnitude of the field’s gender
                  gap above and beyond their beliefs about the level
                  of mathematical and verbal skills required. Finally,
                  we found that beliefs about the importance of
                  brilliance to success in a field may predict its
                  female representation in part by fostering the
                  impression that the field demands solitary work and
                  competition with others. These results suggest new
                  solutions for enhancing diversity within STEM and
                  across the academic spectrum.}

                  as housework, childcare, care for elders, and other

                  interviews with faculty, the article examines how
                  gender is related to time spent on the different
                  components of faculty work, as well as on housework
                  and care. Findings show that many faculty report
                  working more than 60 hours a week, with substantial
                  time on weekends devoted to work. Finding balance
                  between different kinds of work (research, teaching,
                  mentoring, and service) is as difficult as finding
                  balance between work and personal life. The study
                  further explores how gendered care giving, in
                  particular being a mother to young children, is
                  related to time spent on faculty work, controlling
                  for partner employment and other factors. Men and
                  women devote significantly different amounts of time
                  to housework and care giving. While men and women
                  faculty devote the same overall time to their
                  employment each week, mothers of young children
                  spend less time on research, the activity that

                  scholarship, but a lack of appropriate data has
                  prevented its clear assessment. Here, we quantify
                  the impact of parenthood on scholarship using an
                  extensive survey of the timing of parenthood events,
                  longitudinal publication data, and perceptions of
                  research expectations among 3064 tenure-track
                  faculty at 450 Ph.D.-granting computer science,
                  history, and business departments across the United
                  States and Canada, along with data on
                  institution-specific parental leave
                  policies. Parenthood explains most of the gender
                  productivity gap by lowering the average short-term
                  productivity of mothers, even as parents tend to be
                  slightly more productive on average than
                  nonparents. However, the size of productivity
                  penalty for mothers appears to have shrunk over
                  time. Women report that paid parental leave and
                  adequate childcare are important factors in their
                  recruitment and retention. These results have broad

                  outcomes based on author gender and nationality. To
                  address this, we examined the peer review outcomes
                  of 23,876 initial submissions and 7,192 full
                  submissions that were submitted to the biosciences
                  journal eLife between 2012 and 2017. Women and
                  authors from nations outside of North America and
                  Europe were underrepresented both as gatekeepers
                  (editors and peer reviewers) and authors. We found
                  evidence of a homophilic relationship between the
                  demographics of the gatekeepers and authors in
                  determining the outcome of peer review; that is,
                  gatekeepers favored manuscripts from authors of the
                  same gender and from the same country. The
                  acceptance rate for manuscripts with male last
                  authors was higher than for female last authors, and
                  this gender inequity was greatest when the team of
                  reviewers was all male; mixed-gender gatekeeper
                  teams lead to more equitable peer review
                  outcomes. Homogeny between the country affiliation
                  of the gatekeeper and the corresponding author also
                  lend to improved acceptance rates for many
                  countries. We conclude with a discussion of
                  mechanisms that could contribute to this effect,

                  faculty for promotion and tenure has generally
                  followed the dictate "publish or perish," where
                  "publish" has had its standard academic meaning of
                  "publish in archival journals" [Academic Careers,
                  94]. Relying on journal publications as the sole
                  demonstration of scholarly achievement, especially
                  counting such publications to determine whether they
                  exceed a prescribed threshold, ignores significant
                  evidence of accomplishment in computer science and
                  engineering. For example, conference publication is
                  preferred in the field, and computational artifacts
                  --software, chips, etc. --are a tangible means of
                  conveying ideas and insight. Obligating faculty to
                  be evaluated by this traditional standard handicaps
                  their careers, and indirectly harms the field. This
                  document describes appropriate evidence of academic

                  and fairness of modern peer-review practices in
                  publication and funding are apparent across a wide
                  range of scientific disciplines. Although questions
                  about reliability, accountability, reviewer bias,
                  and competence have been raised, there has been very
                  little direct research on these variables.  The
                  present investigation was an attempt to study the
                  peer-review process directly, in the natural setting
                  of actual journal referee evaluations of submitted
                  manuscripts. As test materials we selected 12
                  already published research articles by investigators
                  from prestigious and highly productive American
                  psychology departments, one article from each of 12
                  highly regarded and widely read American psychology
                  journals with high rejection rates (80\%) and
                  nonblind refereeing practices.  With fictitious
                  names and institutions substituted for the original
                  ones (e.g., Tri-Valley Center for Human Potential),
                  the altered manuscripts were formally resubmitted to
                  the journals that had originally refereed and
                  published them 18 to 32 months earlier. Of the
                  sample of 38 editors and reviewers, only three (8\%)
                  detected the resubmissions. This result allowed nine
                  of the 12 articles to continue through the review
                  process to receive an actual evaluation: eight of
                  the nine were rejected. Sixteen of the 18 referees
                  (89\%) recommended against publication and the
                  editors concurred. The grounds for rejection were in
                  many cases described as "serious methodological
                  flaws." A number of possible interpretations of
                  these data are reviewed and evaluated.}

  abstract =	 {Despite growing interest in Open Access (OA) to
                  scholarly literature, there is an unmet need for
                  large-scale, up-to-date, and reproducible studies
                  assessing the prevalence and characteristics of
                  OA. We address this need using oaDOI, an open online
                  service that determines OA status for 67 million
                  articles. We use three samples, each of 100,000
                  articles, to investigate OA in three populations:
                  (1) all journal articles assigned a Crossref DOI,
                  (2) recent journal articles indexed in Web of
                  Science, and (3) articles viewed by users of
                  Unpaywall, an open-source browser extension that
                  lets users find OA articles using oaDOI. We estimate
                  that at least 28\% of the scholarly literature is OA
                  (19M in total) and that this proportion is growing,
                  driven particularly by growth in Gold and
                  Hybrid. The most recent year analyzed (2015) also
                  has the highest percentage of OA (45\%). Because of
                  this growth, and the fact that readers
                  disproportionately access newer articles, we find
                  that Unpaywall users encounter OA quite frequently:
                  47\% of articles they view are OA. Notably, the most
                  common mechanism for OA is not Gold, Green, or
                  Hybrid OA, but rather an under-discussed category we
                  dub Bronze: articles made free-to-read on the
                  publisher website, without an explicit Open
                  license. We also examine the citation impact of OA
                  articles, corroborating the so-called open-access
                  citation advantage: accounting for age and
                  discipline, OA articles receive 18\% more citations
                  than average, an effect driven primarily by Green
                  and Hybrid OA. We encourage further research using
                  the free oaDOI service, as a way to inform OA policy
                  and practice.}

                  also explores sex differences in patterns of single
                  authorship and co-authorship. To do so, demographic
                  data of the UK social sci- ences is compared with a
                  sample of UK-authored journal articles. The findings
                  of the study show that, overall, female academics
                  contribute to a lower proportion of journal articles
                  than the proportion of academic staff that they
                  constitute. However, within certain disciplines
                  (social pol- icy and psychology) women publish
                  articles at a level comparable with the proportion
                  of the discipline that they constitute. These
                  findings, it is argued, can be helpfully understood
                  as both cause and consequence of the gendered
                  academy.}

                  papers recognition in author-pays OA journals in
                  2007–2011. This is the first large scale study
                  concentrating on all APC-funded OA journals
                  published by Springer and Elsevier as the two
                  greatest publishers authorizing and embracing the
                  model. According to the research findings, the OA
                  papers have been exponentially increased in recent
                  years. They are, also, found to outperform the TA
                  ones in their impacts whether in the annual
                  comparisons or across disciplines. The annual OA
                  citation advantages range from 21.36\% for 2009 to
                  49.71\% for 2008. Social Sciences and Humanities
                  (with 3.14\%) and Natural Sciences (with 35.95\%)
                  gain the lowest and the highest advantages,
                  respectively. The citation advantage can be
                  attributed to the higher visibility of the OA
                  articles, implying the popularity and usefulness of
                  the OA author-pays model to their readership. It
                  may, also, have roots in the selectivity of the
                  authors in choosing the author-pays outlet to
                  publish their high-quality papers, signifying the
                  overall prestige of the OA papers published in the
                  model. Whatever may be the ultimate interpretation,
                  i.e. correlation or causation, the OA citation
                  advantage may encourage the authors who are willing
                  to support OA movement, while seeking to get
                  published in the well-established traditional
                  journals. This may help approach the
                  not-yet-achieved critical mass necessary to evaluate
                  the success of the model.}

                  with complete data on 145 journals in various fields
                  of research, including about 1.7 million authors and
                  740,000 referees.  We reconstructed three possible
                  sources of bias, i.e., the editorial selection of
                  referees, referee recommendations, andeditorial
                  decisions, and examined all their possible
                  relationships.  In line with previous research, we
                  found that editors were sensitive to gender
                  homophily in that they tended to match authors and
                  referee by gender systematically.  Results showed
                  that in general manuscripts written by women as solo
                  authors or co-authored by women are treated even
                  more favorably by referees and editors.  This is
                  especially so in biomedicine and health journals,
                  whereas women were treated relatively less favorably
                  in social science & humanities journals, i.e., the
                  field in which the ratio offemale authors was the
                  highest in our sample.  Although with some caveat,
                  our findings suggestthat peer review and editorial
                  processes in scholarly journals do not penalize
                  manuscripts bywomen.  However, considering the
                  complex social nature of gender prejudices, journals
                  shouldincrease gender diversity among reviewers and
                  editors as a means of correcting signals

                  characteristics of fields and study topics;
                  methodology; document type; study design;
                  characteristics of results and discussion; use of
                  figures and appendix in papers; characteristics of
                  the titles and abstracts; characteristics of
                  references; length of paper; age of paper; early
                  citation and speed of citation; accessibility and
                  visibility of papers. Category two: “journal related
                  factors”: journal impact factor; language of
                  journal; scope of journal; form of
                  publication. Category three: “author(s) related
                  factors”: number of authors; author’s reputation;
                  author’s academic rank; self-citations;
                  international and national collaboration of authors;
                  authors’ country; gender, age and race of authors;
                  author’s productivity; organizational features; and
                  funding. Probably some factors such as the quality
                  of the paper, journal impact factor, number of
                  authors, visibility and international cooperation
                  are stronger predictors for citations, than authors’
                  gender, age and race; characteristics of results and
                  discussion and so on.}

  abstract =	 {Peer review may be “single-blind,” in which
                  reviewers are aware of the names and affiliations of
                  paper authors, or “double-blind,” in which this
                  information is hidden. Noting that computer science
                  research often appears first or exclusively in
                  peer-reviewed conferences rather than journals, we
                  study these two reviewing models in the context of
                  the 10th Association for Computing Machinery
                  International Conference on Web Search and Data
                  Mining, a highly selective venue (15.6\% acceptance
                  rate) in which expert committee members review
                  full-length submissions for acceptance. We present a
                  controlled experiment in which four committee
                  members review each paper. Two of these four
                  reviewers are drawn from a pool of committee members
                  with access to author information; the other two are
                  drawn from a disjoint pool without such access. This
                  information asymmetry persists through the process
                  of bidding for papers, reviewing papers, and
                  entering scores. Reviewers in the single-blind
                  condition typically bid for 22\% fewer papers and
                  preferentially bid for papers from top universities
                  and companies. Once papers are allocated to
                  reviewers, single-blind reviewers are significantly
                  more likely than their double-blind counterparts to
                  recommend for acceptance papers from famous authors,
                  top universities, and top companies. The estimated
                  odds multipliers are tangible, at 1.63, 1.58, and
                  2.10, respectively.},

                  disadvantage of immigrants in U.S. labor
                  market. When examining the mechanism of such
                  disadvantage, previous research has pointed to the
                  factor of lower human capital as a portion of
                  immigrants completed their education before
                  immigration. This study builds on the previous
                  research and further investigates both place of
                  college and where they completed education on the
                  earnings among immigrant scientists and
                  engineers. In addition to the human capital, this
                  study captures factors pertaining to
                  acculturation. Using data from Scientists and
                  Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT), I divide
                  the immigrant scientists and engineers into fully
                  foreign-educated, fully U.S.-educated and mixed
                  foreign- and U.S.-educated groups. These categories
                  are regressed against the native-born in a full
                  sample and subsamples of men and women,
                  respectively. The full-sample analysis shows that
                  immigrant scientists and engineers who have received
                  their college education abroad are at an earnings
                  disadvantage, regardless of whether they completed
                  their higher degrees in or outside the United
                  States. However, their earnings can rise faster than
                  their native-born peers if they completed their
                  education in the United States. The results suggest
                  that attending college and/or pre-college in
                  U.S. plays a more substantial role in closing the
                  earnings gap between immigrants and non-immigrants
                  among scientists and engineers. Gender-specific
                  analyses reveal that the earnings gap between
                  immigrants and native-born women is narrower than
                  that between their male counterparts, showing gender
                  may play a more salient role in earnings
                  disadvantage than immigrant status.},
