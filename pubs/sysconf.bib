  abstract =	 "Background Although there has been a continuous
                  increase in the number of women working in the field
                  of medicine, women rarely reach the highest academic
                  positions as full professors or editorial board
                  members.  Objective We aimed to determine the
                  proportion of women on the editorial boards of
                  top-ranked medical journals in different medical
                  specialties.  Methods We analyzed the gender of
                  editorial board members of 60 top-ranked journals of
                  12 Thomson Reuters Web of Knowledge Journal Citation
                  Reports categories. A total of 4175 editors were
                  included in our analysis.  Results Only 15.9% (10 of
                  63) editors-in-chief were female. In the 5
                  categories, critical care, anesthesiology,
                  orthopedics, ophthalmology and radiology, nuclear
                  medicine and medical imaging, currently not 1 woman
                  holds the position of editor-in-chief. Less than one
                  fifth (17.5%, 719 of 4112) of all editorial board
                  members were women. There were significant
                  differences among the evaluated categories, with the
                  highest percentage of women in the category of
                  medicine, general and internal and the lowest in the
                  category critical care, followed by orthopedics. In
                  every category, the proportion of women as editorial
                  board members was substantially lower than that of
                  men.  Conclusions Women are underrepresented on the
                  editorial boards of major medical journals, although
                  there is a great variability among the journals and
                  categories analyzed. If more women are nominated to
                  serve on editorial boards, they will be a visible
                  sign of continuing progress and serve as important
                  role models for young women contemplating a career
                  in academic medicine."

                  adherence, and topical bias. From our findings, we

                  authorship of scholarly publications.  However, the
                  reported results vary according to objectives of the
                  study, size and source of the data, techniques and
                  methods used for the analysis. Therefore, these

                  authorships, 2) data and techniques used for
                  detection of author’s gender need more geographic
                  inclusions, 3) new techniques and methods should be
                  adopted for more precise and inclusive analysis, and
                  4) the results, techniques and methods should be
                  tested thoroughly from different sources of data and

                  regression model (LRM) with a total of 1,745

                  rest on a set of studies undergirding policies and
                  programs aimed at remediation. More recent and
                  robust empiricism, however, fails to support
                  assertions of discrimination in these domains. To
                  better understand women’s underrepresentation in
                  math-intensive fields and its causes, we reprise
                  claims of discrimination and their evidentiary
                  bases. Based on a review of the past 20 years of
                  data, we suggest that some of these claims are no
                  longer valid and, if uncritically accepted as
                  current causes of women’s lack of progress, can
                  delay or prevent understanding of contemporary
                  determinants of women’s underrepresentation. We
                  conclude that differential gendered outcomes in the
                  real world result from differences in resources
                  attributable to choices, whether free or
                  constrained, and that such choices could be
                  influenced and better informed through education if
                  resources were so directed. Thus, the ongoing focus
                  on sex discrimination inreviewing, and hiring
                  represents costly, misplaced effort: Society is
                  engaged in the present in solving problems of the
                  past, rather than in addressing meaningful
                  limitations deterring women’s participation in
                  science, technology, engineering, andmathematics
                  careers today. Addressing today’s causes of
                  underrep-resentation requires focusing on education
                  and policy changesthat will make institutions
                  responsive to differing biological reali-ties of the
                  sexes. Finally, we suggest potential avenues of
                  intervention to increase gender fairness that accord
                  with current, asopposed to historical,findings.},

                  acceptability of scientific papers for
                  publication. Yet there are few prospective data
                  defining the accuracy or reproducibility of this
                  method. This study was aimed at evaluating
                  interrater consistency in reviewing a single
                  manuscript and at determining whether a referee's
                  likely predisposition (inferred from his or her own
                  published papers in the field) influences his or her
                  attitude toward this manuscript. A computerized
                  search identified 33 first authors of research
                  papers about transcutaneous electrical nerve
                  stimulation. They were asked to review part of a
                  fictitious scientific paper on the topic; they were
                  not made aware of being tested. Reviewers' ratings
                  were recorded by multiple-choice answers in a
                  structured questionnaire. The analyses of the
                  answers revealed poor interrater
                  reliability. Furthermore, referees were clearly
                  influenced by their own preconceptions and judged
                  according to their own published experience in that
                  particular medical subject. That is, referees who
                  would be expected to agree with the paper's findings
                  tended to judge it less harshly than did referees
                  who would be expected to disagree. These results
                  suggest significant impact of reviewer bias on
                  referees' judgment and imply that the peer review
                  system in its present form has room for improvements
                  in fairness and consistency.},

                  two blinded reviewers, the two nonblinded reviewers,
                  and the editors to the number of articles published
                  previously by the first and senior authors (as
                  determined from requested curricula vitae). Blinded
                  reviewers were sent a questionnaire asking whether
                  they could determine the identity of the authors,
                  how they knew, and whether they thought binding
                  changed the quality or difficulty of their review.
                  Results: The Wilcoxon Sign Rank Test disclosed no
                  differences between blinded and nonblinded
                  scores. The number of previous articles by the
                  senior author was significantly correlated (P < .01)
                  with blinded scores (r = -.45) and editors'
                  decisions (r = -.45), but not with nonblinded
                  scores; the number of articles by the first author
                  was correlated (P < .05) with editors' decisions (r
                  = -.35) but not with blinded or nonblinded
                  scores. Fifty (46\%) of 108 blinded reviewers
                  correctly guessed the identity of the authors,
                  mostly from self-references and knowledge of the
                  work; 86\% believed blinding did not change the
                  quality of their review, and 73\% believed it did
                  not change the difficulty of performing a review.
                  Conclusions: Blinded reviewers and editors in this
                  study, but not nonblinded reviewers, gave better
                  scores to authors with more previous articles. These
                  results suggest that blinded reviewers may provide
                  more unbiased reviews and that nonblinded reviewers
                  may be affected by various types of bias.}

  abstract =	 {1.There is a widespread perception in the academic
                  community that peer review is subject to many biases
                  and can be influenced by the identity and biographic
                  features (such as gender) ofmanuscript authors.2.We
                  examined how patterns of authorship differ between
                  men and women, and whetherauthor gender influences
                  editorial and peer review outcomes and/or the peer
                  review process forpapers submitted to the
                  journalFunctional Ecologybetween 2010 and
                  2014.3.Women represented approximately a third of
                  all authors on papers submitted
                  toFunctionalEcology. Relative to overall frequency
                  of authorship, women were underrepresented as
                  soloauthors (26\% were women). On multi-authored
                  papers, women were also underrepresented
                  aslast/senior authors (25\% were women) but
                  overrepresented as first authors (43\% were
                  women).Women first authors were less likely than men
                  first authors to serve as corresponding and
                  sub-mitting author of their papers; this difference
                  was not influenced by the gender of the
                  lastauthor. Women were more likely to be authors on
                  papers if the last author was female.4.Papers with
                  female authors (i) were equally likely to be sent
                  for peer review, (ii) obtainedequivalent peer review
                  scores and (iii) were equally likely to be accepted
                  for publication, com-pared to papers with male
                  authors. There was no evidence that male editors or
                  male reviewerstreated papers authored by women
                  differently than did female editors and reviewers,
                  and noevidence that more senior editors reached
                  different decisions than younger editors after
                  review,or cumulative through the entire process, for
                  papers authored by men vs. women.5.Papers authored
                  by women were more likely to be reviewed by
                  women. This is primarilybecause women were more
                  likely to be invited to review if the authors on a
                  paper were femalethan if the authors were
                  male.6.Patterns of authorship, and the role
                  undertaken as author (e.g., submitting and serving
                  ascorresponding author), differ notably between men
                  and women for papers submitted toFunc-tional
                  Ecology. However, consistent with a growing body of
                  literature indicating that peerreview underlying the
                  scholarly publishing process is largely
                  gender-neutral, outcomes of edito-rial and peer
                  review atFunctional Ecologywere not influenced by

                  percentages among undergraduate majors and among
                  degree recipients of four basic factors: (1) the
                  percentage of faculty who are women in the students'
                  major science/engineering area; (2) the students'
                  disciplines (biology, physical sciences, and
                  engineering); (3) the type of institution in which
                  students are enrolled (“Research I” vs. others); and
                  (4) a time trend (1984–2000). Method. We use
                  longitudinal, multivariate, and multi‐institutional
                  data from the Integrated Postsecondary Data System
                  (IPEDS) and from a mail survey of
                  registrars. Results. Over the observation period,
                  the women's percentages have risen steadily. The
                  effects of disciplines and departments are stronger
                  than those of institutions. Especially notable is
                  that the percentages of women among undergraduate
                  science/engineering majors and degree recipients are
                  associated with the percentages of women among the
                  faculty in these fields. Conclusion. The findings
                  contribute empirically to the discussion about the
                  effects of “role models” for the participation and
                  performance of women in science and engineering—and
                  point to the strong effects of departments, compared
                  to institutions, in accounting for degrees awarded
                  to undergraduate women.}

                  has been little empirical research on gender

                  implementation of the science and technology (S&T)
                  policies. This article aims to present a
                  comprehensive gendered analysis of engineering
                  publications across different specialties and
                  provide a cross-gender analysis of research output
                  and scientific impact of engineering researchers in
                  academic, governmental, and industrial sectors. For
                  this purpose, 679,338 engineering articles published
                  from 2008 to 2013 are extracted from the Web of
                  Science database and 974,837 authorships are
                  analyzed. The structures of co-authorship
                  collaboration networks in different engineering
                  disciplines are examined, highlighting the role of
                  female scientists in the diffusion of knowledge. The
                  findings reveal that men dominate 80\% of all the
                  scientific production in engineering. Women
                  engineers publish their papers in journals with
                  higher Impact Factors than their male peers, but
                  their work receives lower recognition (fewer
                  citations) from the scientific
                  community. Engineers—regardless of their
                  gender—contribute to the reproduction of the
                  male-dominated scientific structures through forming
                  and repeating their collaborations predominantly
                  with men. The results of this study call for
                  integration of data driven gender-related policies
                  in existing S&T discourse.},

                  of the intersection of immigration and gender among
                  scientists and engineers. Methods. We use data from
                  the 5\% Public Use Microsample (PUMS) of the 1990
                  census and the longitudinal 1982-1989 Survey of
                  Natural and Social Scientists and Engineers (SSE) to
                  compare the labor force outcomes of women immigrant
                  scientists to immigrant men and native-born women
                  scientists. Results. We find that immigrant women
                  are less likely to be employed and promoted than
                  immigrant men and native-born women. Although women
                  immigrants appear to earn slightly less than
                  native-born women, this gap is explained by such
                  factors as field, employment sector, and family
                  characteristics. We suggest that immigration paths
                  may underlie some of the labor force disadvantages
                  experienced by immigrant women
                  scientists. Conclusions. The results of this paper
                  highlight the importance of considering gender
                  differences, particularly differences in migration
                  path, when studying immigrant
                  scientists. Consideration of gender leads to a
                  fuller understanding of immigrant scientists' labor
                  force outcomes.},

                  use 2014 data from a large national survey of
                  faculty at more than 140 institutions as well as
                  2012 data from an online annual performance
                  reporting system for tenured and tenure–track
                  faculty at two campuses of a large public,
                  Midwestern University. We find evidence in both data
                  sources that, on average, women faculty perform
                  significantly more service than men, controlling for
                  rank, race/ethnicity, and field or department. Our
                  analyses suggest that the male–female differential
                  is driven more by internal service—i.e., service to
                  the university, campus, or department—than external
                  service—i.e., service to the local, national, and
                  international communities—although significant
                  heterogeneity exists across field and discipline in
                  the way gender differentials play out.}

                  publishing and it is essential that peer reviewers
                  are appointed on the basis of their expertise
                  alone. However, it is difficult to check for any
                  bias in the peer-review process because the identity
                  of peer reviewers generally remains
                  confidential. Here, using public information about
                  the identities of 9000 editors and 43000 reviewers
                  from the Frontiers series of journals, we show that
                  women are underrepresented in the peer-review
                  process, that editors of both genders operate with
                  substantial same-gender preference (homophily), and
                  that the mechanisms of this homophily are
                  gender-dependent. We also show that homophily will
                  persist even if numerical parity between genders is
                  reached, highlighting the need for increased efforts
                  to combat subtler forms of gender bias in scholarly

  abstract =	 {Objective: To determine whether articles published
                  in journals using blinded peer review receive
                  significantly more or fewer citations than those
                  published in journals using nonblinded peer review.
                  Design: Drawing from a sample of 1051 full articles
                  published in 28 economics journals during 1984, we
                  used nonlinear regression and ordered probit
                  techniques to estimate the impact of blinded peer
                  review on citations of these articles in 1985
                  through 1989.  Outcomes: Citations of articles.
                  Results: Articles published in journals using
                  blinded peer review were cited significantly more
                  than articles published in journals using nonblinded
                  peer review, controlling for a variety of author,
                  article, and journal attributes.  Conclusions:
                  Nonblinded peer review apparently suffers from type
                  I error to a greater extent than blinded peer
                  review. That is, journals using nonblinded peer
                  review published a larger fraction of papers that
                  should not have been published than do journals
                  using blinded peer review. When reviewers know the
                  identity of the author(s) of an article, they are
                  able to (and evidently do) substitute
                  particularistic criteria for universalistic criteria
                  in their evaluative process.}

  abstract =	 {Professional societies and their conferences provide
                  an important venue for disseminating scientific
                  knowledge. Delivering a keynote for or being named a
                  fellow by an international society is a major
                  recognition. Do such recognitions reflect the
                  composition of the field of bioinformatics? We
                  compiled a list of 412 International Society for
                  Computational Biology honorees (75 fellows and 337
                  keynote speakers). To assess the composition of
                  senior researchers in the field, we analyze the
                  names and affliations of corresponding authors in
                  leading bioinformatics journals. Comparing to the
                  distribution based on names and affliations of
                  honorees, we looked for disparities in gender,
                  country of affliation, race, and
                  name-origin. Name-origin predictions were created
                  using a neural network trained on 700,000
                  name-nationality pairs mined from Wikipedia. The
                  proportion of female honorees has kept pace with
                  increasing levels of female authorship, but neither
                  has yet to reach gender parity. However, we noticed
                  a striking geographic disparity where the proportion
                  of honorees with an affliation in the United States
                  was 1.6-fold greater compared to field-specific
                  senior authors. In total, we estimate the
                  U.S. received 85 more honorees than would be
                  expected from randomly selecting honorees from
                  senior authors. Almost half of the excess in
                  U.S. honorees was accounted for by a deficit of 41
                  honoree slots from China, France, and
                  Italy. Furthermore, within the U.S., we identify
                  racial disparities with an excess of white honorees
                  and a depletion of Asian honorees. This pattern
                  replicated globally, where we find names of East
                  Asian origin have been persistently underrepresented
                  among ISCB honorees. Early indications suggest the
                  ICSB has taken note of our findings by selecting
                  more diverse honorees.Competing Interest

                  of such manuscripts is not known.  Objective.— To
                  assess whether US reviewers or non-US reviewers
                  evaluate manuscripts differently, depending on
                  whether the manuscripts are submitted from outside

                  and Setting.— A retrospective analysis of all
                  original submissions received by Gastroenterology in
                  1995 and 1996. Reviewers ranked manuscripts in 4
                  decision categories: accept, provisionally accept,
                  reject with resubmission, or reject.  Main Outcome
                  Measure.— Ranking of papers based on nationality of
                  authors and reviewers.  Results.— The percentage of
                  non-US manuscripts placed in each decision category
                  by US (n=2355) and non-US reviewers (n=1297) was

                  recommended acceptance of papers submitted by US
                  authors more often than did non-US reviewers
                  (P=.001). Non-US reviewers ranked US papers slightly
                  more favorably than non-US papers (P=.09), while US
                  reviewers ranked US papers much more favorably
                  (P=.001).  Conclusions.— Reviewers from the United
                  States and outside the United States evaluate non-US
                  papers similarly and evaluate papers submitted by US
                  authors more favorably, with US reviewers having a

                  millions of records from dedicated bibliographic
                  databases zbMATH, arXiv, and ADS, we unveil the
                  chronological evolution of authorships by women in
                  mathematics, physics, and astronomy. We observe a
                  pronounced shortage of female authors in top-ranked
                  journals, with quasi-stagnant figures in various
                  distinguished periodicals in the first two
                  disciplines and a significantly more equitable
                  situation in the latter. Additionally, we provide an
                  interactive open-access web interface to further
                  examine the data. To address whether female scholars
                  submit fewer articles for publication to relevant
                  journals or whether they are consciously or
                  unconsciously disadvantaged by the peer review
                  system, we also study authors’ perceptions of their
                  submission practices and analyze around 10,000
                  responses, collected as part of a recent global
                  survey of scientists. Our analysis indicates that
                  men and women perceive their submission practices to
                  be similar, with no evidence that a significantly
                  lower number of submissions by women is responsible
                  for their underrepresentation in top-ranked
                  journals. According to the self-reported responses,
                  a larger number of articles submitted to prestigious
                  venues correlates rather with aspects associated
                  with pronounced research activity, a
                  well-established network, and academic seniority.}

                  as housework, childcare, care for elders, and other
                  long‐term care. Drawing on surveys and focus group
                  interviews with faculty, the article examines how
                  gender is related to time spent on the different
                  components of faculty work, as well as on housework
                  and care. Findings show that many faculty report
                  working more than 60 hours a week, with substantial
                  time on weekends devoted to work. Finding balance
                  between different kinds of work (research, teaching,
                  mentoring, and service) is as difficult as finding
                  balance between work and personal life. The study
                  further explores how gendered care giving, in
                  particular being a mother to young children, is
                  related to time spent on faculty work, controlling
                  for partner employment and other factors. Men and
                  women devote significantly different amounts of time
                  to housework and care giving. While men and women
                  faculty devote the same overall time to their
                  employment each week, mothers of young children
                  spend less time on research, the activity that

                  unequal rates. Existing explanations include the
                  potentially unequal impact of parenthood on
                  scholarship, but a lack of appropriate data has
                  prevented its clear assessment. Here, we quantify
                  the impact of parenthood on scholarship using an
                  extensive survey of the timing of parenthood events,
                  longitudinal publication data, and perceptions of
                  research expectations among 3064 tenure-track
                  faculty at 450 Ph.D.-granting computer science,
                  history, and business departments across the United
                  States and Canada, along with data on
                  institution-specific parental leave
                  policies. Parenthood explains most of the gender
                  productivity gap by lowering the average short-term
                  productivity of mothers, even as parents tend to be
                  slightly more productive on average than
                  nonparents. However, the size of productivity
                  penalty for mothers appears to have shrunk over
                  time. Women report that paid parental leave and
                  adequate childcare are important factors in their
                  recruitment and retention. These results have broad
                  implications for efforts to improve the

                  outcomes based on author gender and nationality. To
                  address this, we examined the peer review outcomes
                  of 23,876 initial submissions and 7,192 full
                  submissions that were submitted to the biosciences
                  journal eLife between 2012 and 2017. Women and
                  authors from nations outside of North America and
                  Europe were underrepresented both as gatekeepers
                  (editors and peer reviewers) and authors. We found
                  evidence of a homophilic relationship between the
                  demographics of the gatekeepers and authors in
                  determining the outcome of peer review; that is,
                  gatekeepers favored manuscripts from authors of the
                  same gender and from the same country. The
                  acceptance rate for manuscripts with male last
                  authors was higher than for female last authors, and
                  this gender inequity was greatest when the team of
                  reviewers was all male; mixed-gender gatekeeper
                  teams lead to more equitable peer review
                  outcomes. Homogeny between the country affiliation
                  of the gatekeeper and the corresponding author also
                  lend to improved acceptance rates for many
                  countries. We conclude with a discussion of
                  mechanisms that could contribute to this effect,
                  directions for future research, and policy
                  implications. Code and anonymized data have been

  abstract =	 {A growing interest in and concern about the adequacy
                  and fairness of modern peer-review practices in
                  publication and funding are apparent across a wide
                  range of scientific disciplines. Although questions
                  about reliability, accountability, reviewer bias,
                  and competence have been raised, there has been very
                  little direct research on these variables.  The
                  present investigation was an attempt to study the
                  peer-review process directly, in the natural setting
                  of actual journal referee evaluations of submitted
                  manuscripts. As test materials we selected 12
                  already published research articles by investigators
                  from prestigious and highly productive American
                  psychology departments, one article from each of 12
                  highly regarded and widely read American psychology
                  journals with high rejection rates (80\%) and
                  nonblind refereeing practices.  With fictitious
                  names and institutions substituted for the original
                  ones (e.g., Tri-Valley Center for Human Potential),
                  the altered manuscripts were formally resubmitted to
                  the journals that had originally refereed and
                  published them 18 to 32 months earlier. Of the
                  sample of 38 editors and reviewers, only three (8\%)
                  detected the resubmissions. This result allowed nine
                  of the 12 articles to continue through the review
                  process to receive an actual evaluation: eight of
                  the nine were rejected. Sixteen of the 18 referees
                  (89\%) recommended against publication and the
                  editors concurred. The grounds for rejection were in
                  many cases described as "serious methodological
                  flaws." A number of possible interpretations of
                  these data are reviewed and evaluated.}

                  2,400 paper submissions, 3,000 reviewers, and 8,000
                  attendees. This represents a growth of nearly 40\%
                  in terms of submissions, 96\% in terms of reviewers,
                  and over 100\% in terms of attendees as compared to
                  the previous year. The massive scale as well as
                  rapid growth of the conference calls for a thorough
                  quality assessment of the peer-review process and
                  novel means of improvement. In this paper, we
                  analyze several aspects of the data collected during
                  the review process, including an experiment
                  investigating the efficacy of collecting ordinal
                  rankings from reviewers. We make a number of key
                  observations, provide suggestions that may be useful
                  for subsequent conferences, and discuss open
                  problems towards the goal of improving peer review.}

                  with complete data on 145 journals in various fields
                  of research, including about 1.7 million authors and
                  740,000 referees.  We reconstructed three possible
                  sources of bias, i.e., the editorial selection of
                  referees, referee recommendations, andeditorial
                  decisions, and examined all their possible
                  relationships.  In line with previous research, we
                  found that editors were sensitive to gender
                  homophily in that they tended to match authors and
                  referee by gender systematically.  Results showed
                  that in general manuscripts written by women as solo
                  authors or co-authored by women are treated even
                  more favorably by referees and editors.  This is
                  especially so in biomedicine and health journals,
                  whereas women were treated relatively less favorably
                  in social science & humanities journals, i.e., the
                  field in which the ratio offemale authors was the
                  highest in our sample.  Although with some caveat,
                  our findings suggestthat peer review and editorial
                  processes in scholarly journals do not penalize
                  manuscripts bywomen.  However, considering the
                  complex social nature of gender prejudices, journals
                  shouldincrease gender diversity among reviewers and
                  editors as a means of correcting signals
                  potentiallybiasing the perceptions of authors and

  abstract =	 {Peer review may be “single-blind,” in which
                  reviewers are aware of the names and affiliations of
                  paper authors, or “double-blind,” in which this
                  information is hidden. Noting that computer science
                  research often appears first or exclusively in
                  peer-reviewed conferences rather than journals, we
                  study these two reviewing models in the context of
                  the 10th Association for Computing Machinery
                  International Conference on Web Search and Data
                  Mining, a highly selective venue (15.6\% acceptance
                  rate) in which expert committee members review
                  full-length submissions for acceptance. We present a
                  controlled experiment in which four committee
                  members review each paper. Two of these four
                  reviewers are drawn from a pool of committee members
                  with access to author information; the other two are
                  drawn from a disjoint pool without such access. This
                  information asymmetry persists through the process
                  of bidding for papers, reviewing papers, and
                  entering scores. Reviewers in the single-blind
                  condition typically bid for 22\% fewer papers and
                  preferentially bid for papers from top universities
                  and companies. Once papers are allocated to
                  reviewers, single-blind reviewers are significantly
                  more likely than their double-blind counterparts to
                  recommend for acceptance papers from famous authors,
                  top universities, and top companies. The estimated
                  odds multipliers are tangible, at 1.63, 1.58, and
                  2.10, respectively.},

                  disadvantage of immigrants in U.S. labor
                  market. When examining the mechanism of such
                  disadvantage, previous research has pointed to the
                  factor of lower human capital as a portion of
                  immigrants completed their education before
                  immigration. This study builds on the previous
                  research and further investigates both place of
                  college and where they completed education on the
                  earnings among immigrant scientists and
                  engineers. In addition to the human capital, this
                  study captures factors pertaining to
                  acculturation. Using data from Scientists and
                  Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT), I divide
                  the immigrant scientists and engineers into fully
                  foreign-educated, fully U.S.-educated and mixed
                  foreign- and U.S.-educated groups. These categories
                  are regressed against the native-born in a full
                  sample and subsamples of men and women,
                  respectively. The full-sample analysis shows that
                  immigrant scientists and engineers who have received
                  their college education abroad are at an earnings
                  disadvantage, regardless of whether they completed
                  their higher degrees in or outside the United
                  States. However, their earnings can rise faster than
                  their native-born peers if they completed their
                  education in the United States. The results suggest
                  that attending college and/or pre-college in
                  U.S. plays a more substantial role in closing the
                  earnings gap between immigrants and non-immigrants
                  among scientists and engineers. Gender-specific
                  analyses reveal that the earnings gap between
                  immigrants and native-born women is narrower than
                  that between their male counterparts, showing gender
                  may play a more salient role in earnings
                  disadvantage than immigrant status.},

                  randomized into one of three groups, and each was
                  sent to two reviewers, who were randomized to
                  receive a blinded or an unblinded copy of the
                  manuscript. Review quality was assessed by two
                  editors and the corresponding author. There was no
                  significant difference in assessment between groups
                  or between editors and authors. Reviews recommending
                  publication were scored more highly than those
